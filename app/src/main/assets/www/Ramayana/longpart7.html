    <p> 'We gladly agree to help you,' Ram promised. The next day Ram and Lakshman set out with Sugriv, Hanuman and their small band of monkeys. They hid themselves in the trees around Valin's city while Sugriv went forward to stand at its gates and bellow terrifyingly to Valin to come out. Infuriated by the challenge, Valin led his soldiers out for battle. The brothers fought angrily in single hand-to-hand combat until Sugriv had to signal for Ram's help. When Ram saw that his friend was weakening, he aimed his arrow at Valin's heart and killed Valin instantly.

        </br><p> Ram had fulfilled his promise. Sugriv was king once again and was ready to help to find Sita. But the summer monsoons had come and the heavy rains made further search ing impossible. Ram had to wait for the summer's end before the search for Sita could begin again.

    </br><p> When the monsoon rain ended at last, it was time for Sugriv to pay his debt to Ram. Sugriv called Hanuman to him. Hanuman could fly and leap so high that he could seize the clouds. H e was also a great magician and so knowledgeable that he could interpret the shastras, the Hindu books of wisdom, better than anyone else. If anyone could find Sita, Hanuman could.

    </br><p> 'In one month,' commanded Sugriv, 'you must report back with what you have found.' Ram had no doubt that Hanuman would find his beloved Sita. 'As a token of my faith in you, Hanuman,' he said, 'here is my ring. When you see Sita, show it to her and she will know that you have come from me.' Hanuman set off with an army of monkeys, and Jambavan the king of the bears and his army went too. Thousands of monkeys and bears searched every corner of the land but without success. As the thirtieth day drew near, Hanuman was in despair, humiliated by his failure to find Sita. He called his army of searchers and made an announcement. 'I have failed in my mission and wasted a month. I cannot face the humiliation of my failure and deserve to die.'

    </br><p> Hanuman was about to kill himself when one of his companions noticed a weak-looking vulture hovering above in the hope that he might make a meal of the dead monkey. The monkey waved to the bird and shouted, 'Your king] atayu saw the wife of Ram being carried away. Can you direct us to her?' The vulture realized these were superhuman creatures on a virtuous quest: he decided to help them.

    </br><p> 'I am Sampati, brother of Jatayu,' he said. 'My wings were burned once when I flew too close to Surya the Sun god. I have lost my strength so I cannot help you physically, but I did once hear a woman calling to Ram and Lakshman as Ravan's chariot flew overhead. I know that the demon lives on an island city a hundred leagues over the southern ocean. It was built by Vishvakarma and is called Lanka.'

    </br><p>Surya the Sun god had promised Sampati that his wings would grow strong again if he ever helped Ram and the bird was still speaking when he found his strength returning and his feathe rs growing back. The bears and monkeys thanked him for his help and as the bird began to try his newly regained power, they sped off to the shores of the Indian Ocean. When they arrived, Hanuman breathed in deeply, swelling his chest with the sea winds. He brandished his tail, and thundered up a nearby mountain with a joyous but terrifying roar. At the top of the mountain, Hanuman paused and prayed, preparing for the mighty leap which would bring him to Lanka, alone, enormous and magnificent. None of his companions would be able to follow him.

    </br><p> Then Hanuman leaped into the air like an arrow, flying among the clouds and over the waves far below until he landed on the island of Lanka. When at last he reached its capital, he decided to wait until dark and then crawl through the gates, but the city's demon sentries noticed him and attacked him. Hanuman slew them all in the combat which followed.

    </br><p> Vicrorious, Hanuman marched into Ravan's palace and searched every terrace and room umil he was certain !hat Sita was not there. He was walking through the courtyards on his way out when he saw a light !!;linerin!!; through the leO\·es of some ashoka trees. He sprang rowards them and saw !hat the light was coming from ita who still glowed with a pale radiance. \\'eak from distress and hunger. Ram' wife sat as still as a statue in her nef. A Hanuman wondered what ro do next, he heard a fanfare oi trumpets and Ra,·an am,·ed. As always Ra,·an spoke to ita of hiS Jo,·e and told her she was foolish ro pine ior Ram. when he. whom e,·en !he gods feared. •ns offerin to marry her. Bur ita refused 10 li ten. and mstead drew a line in the ground between them.

    </br><p>' I will never Step across this lme, because I am Ram's wife and Jo,·e only him. You should not look at the wiie of another man. [,·en now. if you rerum me to Ram, he mi ht iorgn·e you: she said. Furiously, Ra,·an turned awa~·- 'I ha,·e waited nearly a full year for you.' he bellowed. 'If you ha,·e not changed your mind in two month when the year is complete. I "·ill han you slaughtered for m~· breakfast.· Then he marched out.

    </br><p> Hanuman dropped lithely ro the tloor as soon as Ra,·an had left. Head bowed. he approached Sita and respectfully showed her the ring which Ram had sent. He introduced himself, telling her. 'Ram rold me to find you. He is well and worries constant!~· about you.' ita asked tender!~- about Ram and Lak hman and inquired why the~- had not yet come to rescue her. Gently, Hanuman explained ho"· difficult it had been to find her. 'Tell Ram from me,' she said when she had heard the whole srory. ' that I will live ior one month more. After that I swear that I hall die.' ·~·in this she handed Hanuman a jewel so that he could pro,·e he had seen her.

    </br><p> Hanuman promised faithfully 10 do as Ita said and flew off. intending to \\'reak a much h.-·oc and ruin in Lanka as he could before finallv retummg to Ram with hi new . He began b,- destroym, the demones ·es who uarded Ita. \\'hen Rann 's terrified courtier told him that a fearsome monkey had ripped apan the asho ·a ~rove.

Then they

    </br><p> Hanuman gave Sita's jewel to Ram and told him everything that had happened while he had been away. Ram immediately set out with the monkeys and the bears for the sou themmost shores of India. Soon after they arrived, a figure approached Ram and identified himself. 'I am Vibhishan, the brother of Ravan,' he said. 'I have tried to persuade Ra,·an to return Sita to you and stop the bloodshed, but he will not listen to reason so I have come to help Ram in any way I can. I have a special power; I can see !ndrajit, Ravan's warrior son, wherever he may be. That may prove helpful to Ram in the fight which lies ahead.'

    </br><p> Rama thanked Vibhishan and swore to protect him since he had left his home and family to help him. Then Ram made his way down to the shore to pray for the help of Sagar, the god of the ocean, in crossing o'·er to Lanka. On Sagar's advice, the monkeys built a bridge to cross the hundred leagues of ocean between India and Lanka and soon Ram, Lakshman and the armies of bears and monkeys had arrived on the island. The monkeys quickly spread out along the beaches, taking up guard and shouting excitedly. Ram then sent a message to Ravan. 'I ha,·e arri,·ed on Lanka. Return my wife or I shall destroy you and your demons "·ith my arrows. If you do not obey my warning, you will lose e\·erything.'

    </br><p> Ravan was infuriated by Ram's arrogant message and ordered his mighty son Indrajit to march out against him. The battle raged fiercely, but Ram's forces were doing well until Indrajit made himself in,·isible and shot Ram and Lakshman with his magic arrow. It was the same arrow that had struck down Hanuman, for it always returned to its owner after it had been used and it ne,·er missed its target. The arrow injured both of the brothers severely and lndrajit then began shooting at the others-many monkeys and bears were wounded by his arrows for they could not see where the next attack would come from. At last Ra\'3n's brother Vibhishan used his own special powers to find Indrajit and wound him: lndrajit was forced to withdraw, boasting that he had killed Ram and Lakshman. The surviving bears and monkeys gazed mournfully down at Ram's unconscious body and to their relief, saw him stir. Suddenly there was a great flash of fire in the sky. Out of it emerged a magnificent eagle: it was Vishnu's mount, Garuda. Swooping down like a fiery meteor he spoke to Ram, 'I have been sent to restore you and Lakshman back to health.' He then embraced them both, filling them with new life, and flew back into the sky. In his palace, Ravan heard the excited cheers of the monkeys and rallied the best of his warriors. Fearsome demons charged out of the city but Hanuman killed them all single-handedly, and Ravan and his soldiers were driven back. Ravan knew his only chance now was to awaken his brother, the gluttonous giant Kumbhakarna who slept for six months of the year. It took the noise of everyone in the city to wake him but after much persuasion, Kumbhakarna agreed to help Ravan and gulped down 2000 jars of liquor to strengthen himself before setting out to kill Ram. Kumbhakarna drunkenly lurched towards Ram's armies whirling his mace around his head. The battle seemed lost and once more the bears and monkeys were slaughtered in their hundreds. Ram once again set his bow to work, aiming a steady stream of arrows at the giant. At last, Kumbhakama fell to the ground but he still waved his arms and legs about and knocked down whole troops of monkeys before Ram raised his bow and killed him with a deadly arrow. For a time, the fighting ceased but soon !ndrajit had recovered enough to return to the battle. He flew in his chariot abo\'e the ranks of bears and monkeys, showering them with arrows and lances. Only when J ambavan, Sugriv, Ram and Lakshman had all been wounded did Indrajit withdraw to his palace and the battle ended for the day.

    </br><p>That night, Jambavan the king of the bears wid Hanuman of some healing herbs on :\1ount Kailash, the home of Shiv. 'The herbs will heal our wounded,' he said, 'if )'OU can find them.' Hanuman flew directly to Kailash but was unable 10 recognize the herbs. Desperate to rerum before dawn, he tore off the whole top of the mountain and brought it to Jambavan, who selected the right herbs and cured the injured. Then Hanuman put the summit back in its original place. Filled with new strength and enthusiasm, the monkeys were now determined to end this bitter war swiftly. King Sugriv led them m a charge onto the battlements of Ra,•an's fortress and set the city ablaze. In the following battle, they killed all the remaining demon warriors except Indrajit and Ravan himself. With all h1s warriors dead, the ten-headed king turned to his son.

    </br><p>'Ram is mighty, but you have proved yourself to be mightier, because you have already wounded him twice. Kill Ram and Lakshman and we can still win this war.' !ndrajit attacked again, using every demonic trick he knew to weaken Ram and Lakshman. In order to disheanen Ram, he conjured up an image of Sita in his carriage, an image which looked as if she had been beheaded. Then he again attacked from the sky, but finally Lakshman notched an arrow which had been given to h1m by Indra and shot it at Indrajit. The arrow ripped the demon's head from h1s shoulders and the demon was defeated at last. . ow there was nothmg left for Ravan but to fight Ram himself. Hea\')'-hearted at the loss of his favourite son, Ra,·an charged out of h1s fortress in his magic chanot. He flew into the air and began to shoot arrows down at Ram with all h1s twenty arms. The gods cons1dered this was unfair and they sent Matali the hea,·enly charioteer to ra1se h1m up to an equal height. Then Ram chanted a hymn to the gods and drinking three sips of water purified himself and continued the fight with Ra,·an. Finally, his arrow pierced Ra,·an's hean and knocked him out of his chariot and onto the ground.

    </br><p> Ra,·an 's brother, Vibhishan, looked at the once powerful demon lying dead on the ground caked in blood and dust. 'If only you had done as I said,' he wept, 'all this destruction could ha,·e been avoided.' Ram laid his hand on Vibhishan's shoulder, 'You are a hero. Heroes must fight to the death. It is not suitable for you to grie,·e in this manner. Now prepare to gi,·e your brother a proper funeral.'

    </br><p> Ha,·ing buried Ravan "'ith all the proper rites, Vibhishan was crowned king of Lanka in his place. After the ceremony, Ram sent Hanuman to gi,·e Sita the news of his victory. Hanuman entered the ashoka grove with his head held high and his heart full of happiness. He bowed deeply before Sita, who was waiting anxiously for news of Rama. ' I bring you joyful news, my queen,' he said. 'Ram has asked me to tell you that the war is o,·er, Ravan is dead and right has triumphed.' As he spoke, King Vibhishan's carriage approached in all its splendour. The newly crowned king alighted from the carriage and bowed before Sita.

    </br><p>'If it pleases you, the women of my family shall attend to you and prepare you to meet Ram again.' Sita wept " 'ith joy when she kne"' Ram and Lakshman were safe and that she " 'as about to be united with her husband. She was bathed in Vibhishan's palace, dressed in silks and adorned with jewels. Her hair was threaded with pearls and her skin perfumed with the most delicate and exotic fragrances. When she was ready, Vibhishan instructed his servants to bring out the most magnificent palanquin to carry her to Ram. It stopped by Ram and Sita stepped nimbly down, delighted to be reunited with her husband . She looked up at him shyly yet jubilantly but was stunned by his harsh expression.

    </br><p> 'Daughter of Janak,' he said sternly, 'I have slain the enemy and rescued you. I have done my duty and satisfied the demands of honour. But I cannot take you back. You have been touched by Ravan. How can I know that you are pure? You are free to go where you choose, I have no desire for you.' 'If I was touched by Ravan,' replied Sita with spirit, 'it was not because I chose it. It seems I have waited a long time for a man who does not love me but fought a war merely to satisfy his honour. I married a valiant prince who defended the weak, but you speak now of mistrust and blame like a coarse commoner. You knew my plight when Hanuman told you where I was. Why did you not leave me to my resources? I have no reason to live if my character and my past devotion mean nothing to you.' She turned to Lakshman. 'Prepare a funeral pyre. I intend to enter the flames.' Lakshman looked at Ram but Ram did not try to prevent him, so he did as Sita asked. When the pyre was ready, Sita walked three times around Ram, and prayed to the gods. As she entered the flames Sita whispered a prayer to Agni, god of fire. 'Protect me Agni for you know that I am pure of heart and body.'

    </br><p> Fearlessly Sita stood in the blazing flames awaiting her fate. As they watched, she was suddenly lifted up in the arms of Agni who appeared out of the flames and fixed his intense gaze on Ram. 'Ram,' he said. 'Your wife is chaste and sinless. Embrace her and return to Ayodhya to rule there with her at your side.'

    </br><p> As he spoke all the gods appeared before them. Last of all came Ram's dead father Dasharat in a flying chariot. He spoke gently to his son. 'Ram, you have played your part in a plan of the gods for they themselves could not destroy the demon Ravan. Sita's abduction and suffering were a part of the same plan. If she had not been abducted by Ravan, you would have had no reason to fight him.'

    </br><p> As they entered the city, they met Bharat dressed in ragged clothes, his face saddened by his long separation from his brothers and the unwanted responsibility of ruling the kingdom. When he saw his brother, Bharat's expression changed to one of joy. He immediately bowed to the ground and put the gold sandals on Ram's feet . Ram embraced Bharat and blessed him and together they all returned to the palace. They were received by the court sage Vasishta who seated Ram and Sita on the jewelled throne and blessed them both.

   <p> 'You do not know Ram,' replied Marich, 'he is perfection personified and commands all the forces of good. You cannot defeat him.' 'Not even the gods with their combined powers can stop me,' thundered Ravan. 'You have forgotten my power, how dare you contradict me! It is your place to obey . ow do as l say or l will kill you.'

    </br><p>He gave Marich careful instructions and took him to Panchavati where Ram and his wife and brother were living. There Marich transformed himself into a golden deer and began to graze peacefully in the clearing by Ram's home. Sita caught sight of the deer as she walked among the flowers. It looked at her with melting, sad eyes and she became enchanted by it. 'Ram, Lakshman,' she called. 'Come and look at this deer. Catch it and bring it to me so that I will always be able to look at it.' Ram remembered the warning that a gazelle would be an ill omen but Sita would not be convinced. Lakshman also tried to reason with her, explaining that the gazelle might be one of the few demons left, but Sita did not believe there was any danger and finally Ram agreed to catch the deer for her. However, he told Lakshman not to leave Sita's side and drew a circle around her.

    </br><p>'This magic circle will protect you from demons. Do not step out of it until I return with the deer,' he warned and left to try and catch the lovely animal. The chase was long but at last Ram was close enough to take aim. He intended only to wound the animal slightly so that he could catch it but he misfired and his arrow sank deep into the deer's body. As it fell to the earth, it cried out in Ram's voice, 'Ah, Lakshman! Alas, my Sita!' Sita heard her husband's voice in the distance and thought that he must be hurt and in need of help. 'Go to him immediately,' Sita told Lakshman, 'Ram needs you.'

    </br><p> Lakshman protested. 'Ram left me here to protect you,' he replied . 'He does not need my help.' But Sita wept and pleaded until he agreed to see if Ram had indeed been wounded. o sooner had Lakshman disappeared into the forest than a holy man passed by. 'Who are you who live in the forest, yet are dressed in silk like one of noble birth'' he asked. 'Do you have no protector'' 'I am Sita,' she replied, greeting the holy man respectfully, 'I live here with my husband Ram and his brother Lakshman.' 'Then do your duty, virtuous Sita,' said the holy man, 'and provide me with some food.' Sita stepped out of the magic circle to fetch food for the holy man and as soon as she had done so, he seized her.

    </br><p>'I am the ten-headed Ravan, ruler of Lanka,' he announced. 'Become my bride-you shall command him who commands the gods.' Sita resisted, struggling and pleading, but Ravan gripped her firmly by her hair and, fastening her to his chariot, he flew with her through the air. As the chariot made its way tO Lanka, Sita caught sight of the vulture Jatayu. 'King of birds,' she begged, 'tell Ram that Ravan has kidnapped me.'

    </br><p> Jatayu swooped in front of the chariot, spreading his massive wings to bar Ravan's progress, but the demon drew his sword and sliced off one of the bird's wings so that he tumbled bleeding to the ground, calling to Sita. 'I cannot help you, Sita, but I will tell R>m of your plight.'

    </br><p>As the chariot flew on, Sita threw her jewellery tO the ground, hoping to create a trail for Ram to follow. As they passed over a mountain peak far below, she saw a group of powerful monkeys and threw down ro them some jewellery and a scarf made from cloth of gold in the hope that if Ram came that way in his search, the monkeys would show them to him .

    </br><p> All too soon, they arrived at Lanka where Ravan installed Sita in his palace and started tO court her in the hope that she would agree to be his bride. Sita however had no intention of giving in to Ravan. She veiled her face and reminded him repeatedly that she was the wife of Ram and that she would never agree ro marry him even if the penalty was death.

    </br><p> Finally, Ravan grew weary of her resistance and threw her into a grove of ashoka trees where she was guarded by female demons. 'If you do not come to your senses within a year, I shall eat you,' he told her. Sita waited desperately for Ram to come and save her, but many months passed. Her clothes grew tattered and dirty, her hair lost its shine, and her already slender bodr wasted away until she was scarcely more than skin and bone. Still Ram did not come.

    </br><p>Yet the gods rejoiced, because they knew that the day would soon come when Ram would attack Lanka to rescue Sita and when that day arrived, Ravan would meet his fate .

    </br><p>deer had rurned into a demon as it died but he "'as immediately "'orried about Sita's safety and ran back home. On the way he met Lakshman. 'Why ha,·e you left Sita alone?' he demanded angrily. '\\' e heard your ,·oice and thought you were in danger,' Lakshman explained, 'S1ta 1nsisted that I should see why you called.' Suspecting the worst, the rwo brothers hurried home. On the way they saw Jatayu the \·ulture lying in a pool of blood.

    </br><p>'Ram,' whispered Jatayu. ' ;\lake haste. Ravan, the demon-king of Lanka, has abducted Sita. I could not sa,·e her, though !tried. But I am not sad for I can see golden forests and fields and I know I am about to die and go to heaven. Ravan went southwards. Follow him. Do not despair, you will find Sita.'

    </br><p>Jatayu died and a chariot of fire swooped down and carried his spirit away and out of the fbmes of the funeral pyre which Ram and Lakshman had lit for him.

    </br><p>The brothers tra' elled southwards, searching for information about Sita. Soon they entered a terrifying forest which was filled with monsters and wild beasts. Suddenly they saw the trees before them being ripped out of the soil and crushed underfoot. A huge ogre with arms the size of tree trunks was striding towards them, tearing up everything that stood in his way. The most terrifying thing about him was that he had no head.

    </br><p>Ram and Lakshman had heard stories of this ogre and knew that his name was Kabandha. Lakshman trembled with fear for the first time in his life, and e,·en Ram was not sure that they could defeat this creature, but the brothers did not intend to gi,·e up wi,hout a struggle. They ducked beneath his flailing arms and attacking at the same time, cut them off with their swords. \Yith his arms se,·ered Kabandha lay wounded and helpless. Then in a gentle voice that seemed to come out of the air, he asked who had destroyed him. \\'hen he found they were Ram and Lakshman, he exclaimed joyfully, 'I am released at last!'

    </br><p> Kabandha then explamed that he was an 1m mortal who had tried to challenge lndra's power. The angry god had cut ofi h1s head and told him that he would remain headless until Ram and Lakshman cut off h1s arms. 'Although 1 am immortal, 1 now choose to die and I ask you to cremate my bod~· with all the proper ceremomes so that m\· soul mav find release,' he told them. 'In return 1 shall tell vou how you m1ght find Ita.'

    <p> Ram d1d as Kabandha asked and as the flame>

    <p> rose h1gher, a rad1ant being emerged from the

    <p> fire and spoke to them.

        </br><p> 'Go and find Sugriv, the exiled monkey-king. His brother Valin has usurped h1s throne and you must help Sugri,· to regain 11. Sugnv and his monkeys will then help ~·ou rescue Sita for these monkeys are of di,·ine origin and ha,·e superhuman powers. Sugri,·'s father is said to be Surya the Sun.' Encouraged, Ram and Lakshman hurned on southward. Soon they arri,·ed at a lake wh1ch was ablaze with the dazzling colour and beauty of lotuses and lilies.

    </br><p> Ram waded across the lake, hea,-y-hearted with longing for Sita and as he strode across. he saw a powerful monkey who was as tall as a tower. The monkey's face blazed as red as a ruby and his body glowed like molten gold. His tail stretched out to an enormous distance and he stood on a lofty rock roaring like thunder. As he saw the princes approach, he leaped agilely from the rock and flew O\'er to them, speaking in a ,·oice which was gentle and respectful.

    </br><p> 'Know th at I am Hanuman, son of \'a~· u the god of the wind. ~lv master is ugri,· the monkey king, who has lost his kingdom and hiS wife to his brother. \\' e heard that you were nearby and know vour reputations as warnor . Sugri,· has sent me to greet you and offer hi friendship.'

    </br><p> When Hanuman heard that the brothers had come to seek help, he asked them to it on his shoulders and wnh one m1ghrv leap he earned them to the mountain where ugn,· was. ugnv showed them the scarf and 1ewellen· that 'na had flung down from Ravan's tlnng chanot.

    </br><p> 'Help me win back m\ kingdom trom my wicked brother Valin,' said Sugriv, 'and I

    </br><p> promise to help you bring back Sita.'

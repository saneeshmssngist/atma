        The beautiful city of Ayodhya was the capital of the kingdom of Kosala, and was ruled by
        Dasharat who was known far and wide for his bravery in battle. He had even occasionally
        helped the gods in their fights against demons-a privilege that was granted to few mortals.
        Dasharat's people loved him just as the gods did, because he was kind and fair, but Dasharat
        had a deep sadness in him for in spite of marrying three times he had no heir. His wives,
        princesses from important kingdoms, all remained childless. One day, Vasishta the court sage
        advised Dasharat to perform a sacrifice in order to obtain a son.
        </br>
    <p>A sacrificial fire was lit and Vasishta began performing the ceremonial rituals. As he
        prayed, the flames leaped high into the air and a human form emerged from the fire. Nobody
        realized that it was Vishnu the Restorer. 'Give this to your three queens,' Vishnu said to
        Dasharat and handed him a bowl full of nectar, 'and they will bear you sons.' Dasharat fell
        to his knees and thanked the god and rushed to give the precious food to his wives. Not long
        afterwards Kaushaliya, his first queen, gave birth to a son who was named Rama-Chandra. The
        second queen, Kaikeyi, gave birth to Bharat; and Sumitra, the youngest queen, gave birth to
        the twins Lakshman and Shatrughan.
        </br>
    <p>As the boys grew, Rama-chandra proved himself highly skilled in the ways of kings and was
        equally adept in the skills of the warrior. He resembled the supreme spirit Vishnu, for
        Vishnu had indeed been partly reborn in him for a special purpose on Earth. However, even
        Ram did not realize that part of him was a god. Ram was as dark as a rain cloud. His eyes
        were shaped like the lotus-flower and glistened as blackly as his curly hair. Although his
        frame was slight and slim, he had the powerful waist and chest of a lion. His arms were
        remarkably long and very powerful and his hands, though strong, had delicate fingers tipped
        with nails which glittered like mother-of-pearl. And his face glowed like the clear autumn
        moon, with the beauty of truth and love. Everyone loved him and it was obvious he would be a
        most suitable king. Dasharat, however, had promised his second wife's father when he sought
        her hand that her son would be the crown prince of Ayodhya. This wife, Kaikeyi, was
        Dasharat's favourite wife and he could not bear to upset her. Fortunately, Kaikeyi agreed
        wholeheartedly that Ram should be king.

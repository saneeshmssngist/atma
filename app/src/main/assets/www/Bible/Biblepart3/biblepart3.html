    1 </br></br>Samuel

    1 </br></br>Samuel 1

    1 </br></br>Samuel 1:1 Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim, a Zuphite of the hill-country of
    Ephraim, named Elkanah; he was the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of
    Zuph, an Ephraimite:

    1 </br></br>Samuel 1:2 And he had two wives, one named Hannah and the other Peninnah: and Peninnah
    was the mother of children, but Hannah had no children.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 1:3 Now this man went up from his town every year to give worship and to make
    offerings to the Lord of armies in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests
    of the Lord, were there.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 1:4 And when the day came for Elkanah to make his offering, he gave to Peninnah his
    wife, and to all her sons and daughters, their part of the feast:

    1 </br></br>Samuel 1:5 But to Hannah he gave one part, though Hannah was very dear to him, but the Lord
    had not let her have children.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 1:6 And the other wife did everything possible to make her unhappy, because the Lord
    had not let her have children;

    1 </br></br>Samuel 1:7 And year by year, whenever she went up to the house of the Lord, she kept on
    attacking her, so that Hannah gave herself up to weeping and would take no food.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 1:8 Then her husband Elkanah said to her, Hannah, why are you weeping? and why are
    you taking no food? why is your heart troubled? am I not more to you than ten sons?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 1:9 So after they had taken food and wine in the guest room, Hannah got up. Now Eli the
    priest was seated by the pillars of the doorway of the Temple of the Lord.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 1:10 And with grief in her soul, weeping bitterly, she made her prayer to the Lord.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 1:11 And she made an oath, and said, O Lord of armies, if you will truly take note of the
    sorrow of your servant, not turning away from me but keeping me in mind, and will give me a man-
    child, then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and his hair will never be cut.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 1:12 Now while she was a long time in prayer before the Lord, Eli was watching her
    mouth.
    ---------------------Page 498---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 1:13 For Hannah's prayer came from her heart, and though her lips were moving she
    made no sound: so it seemed to Eli that she was overcome with wine.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 1:14 And Eli said to her, How long are you going to be the worse for drink? Put away the
    effects of your wine from you.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 1:15 And Hannah, answering him, said, No, my lord, I am a woman whose spirit is
    broken with sorrow: I have not taken wine or strong drink, but I have been opening my heart before
    the Lord.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 1:16 Do not take your servant to be a good-for-nothing woman: for my words have come
    from my stored-up sorrow and pain.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 1:17 Then Eli said to her, Go in peace: and may the God of Israel give you an answer to
    the prayer you have made to him.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 1:18 And she said, May your servant have grace in your eyes. So the woman went away,
    and took part in the feast, and her face was no longer sad.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 1:19 And early in the morning they got up, and after worshipping before the Lord they
    went back to Ramah, to their house: and Elkanah had connection with his wife; and the Lord kept
    her in mind.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 1:20 Now the time came when Hannah, being with child, gave birth to a son; and she
    gave him the name </br></br>Samuel, Because, she said, I made a prayer to the Lord for him.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 1:21 And the man Elkanah with all his family went up to make the year's offering to the
    Lord, and to give effect to his oath.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 1:22 But Hannah did not go, for she said to her husband, I will not go till the child has
    been taken from the breast, and then I will take him with me and put him before the Lord, where he
    may be for ever.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 1:23 And her husband Elkanah said to her, Do whatever seems right to you, but not till
    you have taken him from the breast; only may the Lord do as he has said. So the woman, waiting
    there, gave her son milk till he was old enough to be taken from the breast.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 1:24 Then when she had done so, she took him with her, with a three-year old ox and an
    ephah of meal and a skin full of wine, and took him to the house of the Lord at Shiloh: now the
    child was still very young.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 1:25 And when they had made an offering of the ox, they took the child to Eli.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 1:26 And she said, O my lord, as your soul is living, my lord, I am that woman who was
    making a prayer to the Lord here by your side:
    ---------------------Page 499---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 1:27 My prayer was for this child; and the Lord has given him to me in answer to my
    request:

    1 </br></br>Samuel 1:28 So I have given him to the Lord; for all his life he is the Lord's. Then he gave the
    Lord worship there.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:1 And Hannah, in prayer before the Lord, said, My heart is glad in the Lord, my horn is
    lifted up in the Lord: my mouth is open wide over my haters; because my joy is in your salvation.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:2 No other is holy as the Lord, for there is no other God but you: there is no Rock like
    our God.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:3 Say no more words of pride; let not uncontrolled sayings come out of your mouths:
    for the Lord is a God of knowledge, by him acts are judged.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:4 The bows of the men of war are broken, and the feeble are clothed with strength.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:5 Those who were full are offering themselves as servants for bread; those who were in
    need are at rest; truly, she who had no children has become the mother of seven; and she who had a
    family is wasted with sorrow.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:6 The Lord is the giver of death and life: sending men down to the underworld and
    lifting them up.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:7 The Lord gives wealth and takes a man's goods from him: crushing men down and
    again lifting them up;

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:8 Lifting the poor out of the dust, and him who is in need out of the lowest place, to
    give them their place among rulers, and for their heritage the seat of glory: for the pillars of the
    earth are the Lord's and he has made them the base of the world.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:9 He will keep the feet of his holy ones, but the evil-doers will come to their end in the
    dark night, for by strength no man will overcome.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:10 Those who make war against the Lord will be broken; against them he will send his
    thunder from heaven: the Lord will be judge of the ends of the earth, he will give strength to his
    king, lifting up the horn of him on whom the holy oil has been put.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:11 Then Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child became the servant of the
    Lord under the direction of Eli the priest.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:12 Now the sons of Eli were evil and good-for-nothing men, having no knowledge of
    the Lord.
    ---------------------Page 500---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:13 And the priests' way with the people was this: when any man made an offering, the
    priest's servant came while the flesh was being cooked, having in his hand a meat-hook with three
    teeth;

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:14 This he put into the pot, and everything which came up on the hook the priest took
    for himself. This they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:15 And more than this, before the fat was burned, the priest's servant would come and
    say to the man who was making the offering, Give me some of the flesh to be cooked for the priest;
    he has no taste for meat cooked in water, but would have you give it uncooked.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:16 And if the man said to him, First let the fat be burned, then take as much as you
    will; then the servant would say, No, you are to give it to me now, or I will take it by force.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:17 And the sin of these young men was very great before the Lord; for they gave no
    honour to the Lord's offerings.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:18 But </br></br>Samuel did the work of the Lord's house, while he was a child, dressed in a
    linen ephod.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:19 And his mother made him a little robe and took it to him every year when she came
    with her husband for the year's offering.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:20 And every year Eli gave Elkanah and his wife a blessing, saying, May the Lord give
    you offspring by this woman in exchange for the child you have given to the Lord. And they went
    back to their house.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:21 And the Lord had mercy on Hannah and she gave birth to three sons and two
    daughters. And the young </br></br>Samuel became older before the Lord.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:22 Now Eli was very old; and he had news from time to time of what his sons were
    doing to all Israel.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:23 And he said to them, Why are you doing such things? for from all this people I get
    accounts of your evil ways.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:24 No, my sons, the account which is given me, which the Lord's people are sending
    about, is not good.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:25 If one man does wrong to another, God will be his judge: but if a man's sin is
    against the Lord, who will take up his cause? But they gave no attention to the voice of their father,
    for it was the Lord's purpose to send destruction on them.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:26 And the young </br></br>Samuel, becoming older, had the approval of the Lord and of men.
    ---------------------Page 501---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:27 And a man of God came to Eli and said to him, The Lord says, Did I let myself be
    seen by your father's people when they were in Egypt, servants in Pharaoh's house?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:28 Did I take him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest and to go up to my altar
    to make the smoke of the offerings go up and to take up the ephod? Did I give to your father's
    family all the offerings made by fire by the children of Israel?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:29 Why then are you looking with envy on my offerings of meat and of meal which
    were ordered by my word, honouring your sons before me, and making yourselves fat with all the
    best of the offerings of Israel, my people?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:30 For this reason the Lord God of Israel has said, Truly I did say that your family and
    your father's people would have their place before me for ever: but now the Lord says, Let it not be
    so; I will give honour to those by whom I am honoured, and those who have no respect for me will
    be of small value in my eyes.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:31 See, the days are coming when your arm and the arm of your father's people will be
    cut off;

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:32 And never again will there be an old man in your family.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:33 But one man of your family will not be cut off by my hand, and his eyes will be
    made dark, and grief will be in his heart: and all the offspring of your family will come to their end
    by the sword of men.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:34 And this will be the sign to you, which will come on Hophni and Phinehas, your
    sons; death will overtake them on the same day.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:35 And I will make a true priest for myself, one who will do what is in my heart and in
    my mind: and I will make for him a family which will not come to an end; and his place will be
    before my holy one for ever.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 2:36 Then it will be that the rest of your family, anyone who has not been cut off, will go
    down on his knees to him for a bit of silver or a bit of bread, and say, Be pleased to put me into one
    of the priest's places so that I may have a little food.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 3

    1 </br></br>Samuel 3:1 Now the young </br></br>Samuel was the servant of the Lord before Eli. In those days the Lord
    kept his word secret from men; there was no open vision.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 3:2 And at that time, when Eli was resting in his place, (now his eyes were becoming
    clouded so that he was not able to see,)
    ---------------------Page 502---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 3:3 And the light of God was still burning, while </br></br>Samuel was sleeping in the Temple of
    the Lord where the ark of God was,

    1 </br></br>Samuel 3:4 The voice of the Lord said </br></br>Samuel's name; and he said, Here am I.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 3:5 And running to Eli he said, Here am I, for you said my name. And Eli said, I did not
    say your name; go to your rest again. So he went back to his bed.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 3:6 And again the Lord said, </br></br>Samuel. And </br></br>Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, Here
    am I; for you certainly said my name. But he said in answer, I said nothing, my son; go to your rest
    again.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 3:7 Now at that time </br></br>Samuel had no knowledge of the Lord, and the revelation of the
    word of the Lord had not come to him.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 3:8 And for the third time the Lord said </br></br>Samuel's name. And he got up and went to Eli
    and said, Here am I; for you certainly said my name. Then it was clear to Eli that the voice which
    had said the child's name was the Lord's.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 3:9 So Eli said to </br></br>Samuel, Go back: and if the voice comes again, let your answer be,
    Say on, Lord; for the ears of your servant are open. So </br></br>Samuel went back to his bed.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 3:10 Then the Lord came and said as before, </br></br>Samuel, </br></br>Samuel. Then </br></br>Samuel made
    answer, Say on, Lord; for the ears of your servant are open.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 3:11 And the Lord said to </br></br>Samuel, See, I will do a thing in Israel at which the ears of
    everyone hearing of it will be burning.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 3:12 In that day I will do to Eli everything which I have said about his family, from first
    to last.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 3:13 And you are to say to him that I will send punishment on his family for ever, for the
    sin which he had knowledge of; because his sons have been cursing God and he had no control over
    them.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 3:14 So I have made an oath to the family of Eli that no offering of meat or of meal
    which they may make will ever take away the sin of his family.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 3:15 And </br></br>Samuel kept where he was, not moving till the time came for opening the
    doors of the house of God in the morning. And fear kept him from giving Eli an account of his
    vision.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 3:16 Then Eli said, </br></br>Samuel, my son. And </br></br>Samuel answering said, Here am I.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 3:17 And he said, What did the Lord say to you? Do not keep it from me: may God's
    punishment be on you if you keep from me anything he said to you.
    ---------------------Page 503---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 3:18 Then </br></br>Samuel gave him an account of everything, keeping nothing back. And he
    said, It is the Lord; let him do what seems good to him.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 3:19 And </br></br>Samuel became older, and the Lord was with him and let not one of his words
    be without effect.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 3:20 And it was clear to all Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba that </br></br>Samuel had been made a
    prophet of the Lord.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 3:21 And the Lord was seen again in Shiloh; for the Lord gave to </br></br>Samuel in Shiloh the
    revelation of his word.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 4

    1 </br></br>Samuel 4:1 Now at that time the Philistines came together to make war against Israel, and the
    men of Israel went out to war against the Philistines and took up their position at the side of Eben-
    ezer: and the Philistines put their forces in position in Aphek.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 4:2 And the Philistines put their forces in order against Israel, and the fighting was hard,
    and Israel was overcome by the Philistines, who put to the sword about four thousand of their army
    in the field.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 4:3 And when the people came back to their tents, the responsible men of Israel said,
    Why has the Lord let the Philistines overcome us today? Let us get the ark of the Lord's agreement
    here from Shiloh, so that it may be with us and give us salvation from the hands of those who are
    against us.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 4:4 So the people sent to Shiloh and got the ark of the agreement of the Lord of armies
    whose resting-place is between the winged ones; and Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli,
    were there with the ark of God's agreement.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 4:5 And when the ark of the Lord's agreement came into the tent-circle, all Israel gave a
    great cry, so that the earth was sounding with it.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 4:6 And the Philistines, hearing the noise of their cry, said, What is this great cry among
    the tents of the Hebrews? Then it became clear to them that the ark of the Lord had come to the
    tent-circle.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 4:7 And the Philistines, full of fear, said, God has come into their tents. And they said,
    Trouble is ours! for never before has such a thing been seen.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 4:8 Trouble is ours! Who will give us salvation from the hands of these great gods?
    These are the gods who sent all sorts of blows on the Egyptians in the waste land.
    ---------------------Page 504---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 4:9 Be strong, O Philistines, be men! Do not be servants to the Hebrews as they have
    been to you: go forward to the fight without fear.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 4:10 So the Philistines went to the fight, and Israel was overcome, and every man went
    in flight to his tent: and great was the destruction, for thirty thousand footmen of Israel were put to
    the sword.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 4:11 And the ark of God was taken; and Hophni and Phinehas, the sons of Eli, were put
    to the sword.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 4:12 And a man of Benjamin went running from the fight and came to Shiloh the same
    day with his clothing out of order and earth on his head.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 4:13 And when he came, Eli was seated by the wayside watching: and in his heart was
    fear for the ark of God. And when the man came into the town and gave the news, there was a great
    outcry.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 4:14 And Eli, hearing the noise and the cries, said, What is the reason of this outcry?
    And the man came quickly and gave the news to Eli.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 4:15 Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were fixed so that he was not able
    to see.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 4:16 And the man said to Eli, I have come from the army and have come in flight today
    from the fight. And he said, How did it go, my son?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 4:17 And the man said, Israel went in flight from the Philistines, and there has been great
    destruction among the people, and your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of
    God has been taken.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 4:18 And at these words about the ark of God, Eli, falling back off his seat by the side of
    the doorway into the town, came down on the earth so that his neck was broken and death overtook
    him, for he was an old man and of great weight. He had been judging Israel for forty years.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 4:19 And his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was with child and near the time
    when she would give birth; and when she had the news that the ark of God had been taken and that
    her father-in-law and her husband were dead, her pains came on her suddenly and she gave birth.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 4:20 And when she was very near death the women who were with her said, Have no
    fear, for you have given birth to a son. But she made no answer and gave no attention to it.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 4:21 And she gave the child the name of Ichabod, saying, The glory has gone from
    Israel: because the ark of God was taken and because of her father-in-law and her husband.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 4:22 And she said, The glory is gone from Israel, for the ark of God has been taken.
    ---------------------Page 505---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 5

    1 </br></br>Samuel 5:1 Now the Philistines, having taken the ark of God, took it with them from Eben-ezer
    to Ashdod.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 5:2 They took the ark of God into the house of Dagon and put it by the side of Dagon.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 5:3 And when the people of Ashdod got up early on the morning after, they saw that
    Dagon had come down to the earth on his face before the ark of the Lord. And they took Dagon up
    and put him in his place again.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 5:4 And when they got up early on the morning after, Dagon had come down to the earth
    on his face before the ark of the Lord; and his head and his hands were broken off on the doorstep;
    only the base was in its place.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 5:5 So to this day no priest of Dagon, or any who come into Dagon's house, will put his
    foot on the doorstep of the house of Dagon in Ashdod.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 5:6 But the hand of the Lord was hard on the people of Ashdod and he sent disease on
    them through all the country of Ashdod.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 5:7 And when the men of Ashdod saw how it was, they said, Let not the ark of the God
    of Israel be with us, for his hand is hard on us and on Dagon our god.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 5:8 So they sent for all the lords of the Philistines to come together there, and said, What
    are we to do with the ark of the God of Israel? And their answer was, Let the ark of the God of
    Israel be taken away to Gath. So they took the ark of the God of Israel away.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 5:9 But after they had taken it away, the hand of the Lord was stretched out against the
    town for its destruction: and the signs of disease came out on all the men of the town, small and
    great.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 5:10 So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And when the ark of God came to Ekron, the
    people of the town made an outcry, saying, They have sent the ark of the God of Israel to us for the
    destruction of us and of our people.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 5:11 So they sent and got together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, Send
    away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go back to its place, so that it may not be the cause of
    death to us and to our people: for there was a great fear of death through all the town; the hand of
    God was very hard on them there.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 5:12 And those men who were not overtaken by death were cruelly diseased: and the cry
    of the town went up to heaven.
    ---------------------Page 506---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 6

    1 </br></br>Samuel 6:1 Now the ark of the Lord was in the country of the Philistines for seven months.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 6:2 And the Philistines sent for the priests and those who were wise in secret arts, and
    said to them, What are we to do with the ark of the Lord? How are we to send it away to its place?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 6:3 And they said, If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it without
    an offering, but send him a sin-offering with it: then you will have peace again, and it will be clear
    to you why the weight of his hand has not been lifted from you.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 6:4 Then they said, What sin-offering are we to send to him? And they said, Five gold
    images of the growths caused by your disease and five gold mice, one for every lord of the
    Philistines: for the same disease came on you and on your lords.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 6:5 So make images of the growths caused by your disease and of the mice which are
    damaging your land; and give glory to the God of Israel: it may be that the weight of his hand will
    be lifted from you and from your gods and from your land.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 6:6 Why do you make your hearts hard, like the hearts of Pharaoh and the Egyptians?
    When he had made sport of them, did they not let the people go, and they went away?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 6:7 So now, take and make ready a new cart, and two cows which have never come
    under the yoke, and have the cows yoked to the cart, and take their young ones away from them:

    1 </br></br>Samuel 6:8 And put the ark of the Lord on the cart, and the gold images which you are sending
    as a sin-offering in a chest by its side; and send it away so that it may go.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 6:9 If it goes by the land of Israel to Beth-shemesh, then this great evil is his work; but if
    not, then we may be certain that the evil was not his doing, but was the working of chance.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 6:10 And the men did so; they took two cows, yoking them to the cart and shutting up
    their young ones in their living-place:

    1 </br></br>Samuel 6:11 And they put the ark of the Lord on the cart and the chest with the gold images.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 6:12 And the cows took the straight way, by the road to Beth-shemesh; they went by the
    highway, not turning to the right or to the left, and the sound of their voices was clear on the road;
    and the lords of the Philistines went after them as far as the edge of Beth-shemesh.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 6:13 And the people of Beth-shemesh were cutting their grain in the valley, and lifting
    up their eyes they saw the ark and were full of joy when they saw it.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 6:14 And the cart came into the field of </br></br>Joshua the Beth-shemite, and came to a stop
    there by a great stone: and cutting up the wood of the cart they made a burned offering of the cows
    to the Lord.
    ---------------------Page 507---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 6:15 Then the Levites took down the ark of the Lord and the chest in which were the
    gold images, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh made burned offerings
    and gave worship that day before the Lord.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 6:16 And the five lords of the Philistines, having seen it, went back to Ekron the same
    day.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 6:17 Now these are the gold images which the Philistines sent as a sin-offering to the
    Lord; one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron;

    1 </br></br>Samuel 6:18 And the gold mice, one for every town of the Philistines, the property of the five
    lords, walled towns as well as country places: and the great stone where they put the ark of the Lord
    is still in the field of </br></br>Joshua the Beth-shemite to this day.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 6:19 But the Lord sent destruction on seventy men of the people of Beth-shemesh for
    looking into the ark of the Lord; and great was the sorrow of the people for the destruction which
    the Lord had sent on them.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 6:20 And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to keep his place before the Lord,
    this holy God? and to whom may he go from us?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 6:21 And they sent men to the people living in Kiriath-jearim, saying, The Philistines
    have sent back the ark of the Lord; come and take it up to your country.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 7

    1 </br></br>Samuel 7:1 So the men of Kiriath-jearim came and took the ark of the Lord to the house of
    Abinadab in Gibeah, and they made his son Eleazar holy and put the ark in his care.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 7:2 And the ark was in Kiriath-jearim for a long time, as much as twenty years: and all
    Israel was searching after the Lord with weeping.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 7:3 Then </br></br>Samuel said to all Israel, If with all your hearts you would come back to the
    Lord, then put away all the strange gods and the Astartes from among you, and let your hearts be
    turned to the Lord, and be servants to him only: and he will make you safe from the hands of the
    Philistines.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 7:4 So the children of Israel gave up the worship of Baal and Astarte, and became
    worshippers of the Lord only.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 7:5 Then </br></br>Samuel said, Let all Israel come to Mizpah and I will make prayer to the Lord
    for you.
    ---------------------Page 508---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 7:6 So they came together to Mizpah, and got water, draining it out before the Lord, and
    they took no food that day, and they said, We have done evil against the Lord. And </br></br>Samuel was
    judge of the children of Israel in Mizpah.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 7:7 Now when the Philistines had news that the children of Israel had come together at
    Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And the children of Israel, hearing of it,
    were full of fear.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 7:8 And the children of Israel said to </br></br>Samuel, Go on crying to the Lord our God for us to
    make us safe from the hands of the Philistines.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 7:9 And </br></br>Samuel took a young lamb, offering all of it as a burned offering to the Lord;
    and </br></br>Samuel made prayers to the Lord for Israel and the Lord gave him an answer.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 7:10 And while </br></br>Samuel was offering the burned offering, the Philistines came near for
    the attack on Israel; but at the thunder of the Lord's voice that day the Philistines were overcome
    with fear, and they gave way before Israel.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 7:11 And the men of Israel went out from Mizpah and went after the Philistines,
    attacking them till they came under Beth-car.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 7:12 Then </br></br>Samuel took a stone and put it up between Mizpah and Jeshanah, naming it
    Eben-ezer, and saying, Up to now the Lord has been our help.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 7:13 So the Philistines were overcome, and did not come into the country of Israel again:
    and all the days of </br></br>Samuel the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 7:14 And the towns which the Philistines had taken were given back to Israel, from
    Ekron to Gath, and all the country round them Israel made free from the power of the Philistines.
    And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 7:15 And </br></br>Samuel was judge of Israel all the days of his life.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 7:16 From year to year he went in turn to Beth-el and Gilgal and Mizpah, judging Israel
    in all those places.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 7:17 And his base was at Ramah, where his house was; there he was judge of Israel and
    there he made an altar to the Lord.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 8

    1 </br></br>Samuel 8:1 Now when </br></br>Samuel was old, he made his sons </br></br>Judges over Israel.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 8:2 The name of his first son was Joel and the name of his second Abijah: they were
    </br></br>Judges in Beer-sheba.
    ---------------------Page 509---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 8:3 And his sons did not go in his ways, but moved by the love of money took rewards,
    and were not upright in judging.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 8:4 Then all the responsible men of Israel got together and went to </br></br>Samuel at Ramah,

    1 </br></br>Samuel 8:5 And said to him, See now, you are old, and your sons do not go in your ways: give us
    a king now to be our judge, so that we may be like the other nations.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 8:6 But </br></br>Samuel was not pleased when they said to him, Give us a king to be our judge.
    And </br></br>Samuel made prayer to the Lord.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 8:7 And the Lord said to </br></br>Samuel, Give ear to the voice of the people and what they say
    to you: they have not been turned away from you, but they have been turned away from me, not
    desiring me to be king over them.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 8:8 As they have done from the first, from the day when I took them out of Egypt till this
    day, turning away from me and worshipping other gods, so now they are acting in the same way to
    you.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 8:9 Give ear now to their voice: but make a serious protest to them, and give them a
    picture of the sort of king who will be their ruler.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 8:10 And </br></br>Samuel said all these words of the Lord to the people who were desiring a
    king.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 8:11 And he said, This is the sort of king who will be your ruler: he will take your sons
    and make them his servants, his horsemen, and drivers of his war-carriages, and they will go
    running before his war-carriages;

    1 </br></br>Samuel 8:12 And he will make them captains of thousands and of fifties; some he will put to
    work ploughing and cutting his grain and making his instruments of war and building his war-
    carriages.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 8:13 Your daughters he will take to be makers of perfumes and cooks and bread-makers.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 8:14 He will take your fields and your vine-gardens and your olive-gardens, all the best
    of them, and give them to his servants.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 8:15 He will take a tenth of your seed and of the fruit of your vines and give it to his
    servants.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 8:16 He will take your men-servants and your servant-girls, and the best of your oxen
    and your asses and put them to his work.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 8:17 He will take a tenth of your sheep: and you will be his servants.
    ---------------------Page 510---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 8:18 Then you will be crying out because of your king whom you have taken for
    yourselves; but the Lord will not give you an answer in that day.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 8:19 But the people gave no attention to the voice of </br></br>Samuel; and they said, No, but we
    will have a king over us,

    1 </br></br>Samuel 8:20 So that we may be like the other nations, and so that our king may be our judge and
    go out before us to war.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 8:21 Then </br></br>Samuel, after hearing all the people had to say, went and gave an account of it
    to the Lord.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 8:22 And the Lord said to </br></br>Samuel, Give ear to their voice and make a king for them.
    Then </br></br>Samuel said to the men of Israel, Let every man go back to his town.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 9

    1 </br></br>Samuel 9:1 Now there was a man of Benjamin named Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror,
    the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a man of wealth.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 9:2 He had a son named Saul, a specially good-looking young man; there was no one
    better-looking among the children of Israel: he was taller by a head than any other of the people.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 9:3 Now the asses of Saul's father Kish had gone wandering away. And Kish said to his
    son Saul, Take one of the servants with you, and get up and go in search of the asses.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 9:4 So they went through the hill-country of Ephraim and through the land of Shalishah,
    but they saw no sign of them: then they went through the land of Shaalim, but they were not there:
    and they went through the land of the Benjamites, but they did not come across them.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 9:5 And when they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to the servant who was with
    him, Come, let us go back, or my father may give up caring about the asses and be troubled about
    us.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 9:6 But the servant said to him, See now, in this town there is a man of God, who is
    highly honoured, and everything he says comes true: let us go there now; it may be that he will give
    us directions about our journey.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 9:7 Then Saul said to his servant, But if we go, what are we to take the man? all our
    bread is gone, and we have no offering to take to the man of God: what are we to do?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 9:8 But the servant said in answer, I have here a fourth part of a shekel of silver: I will
    give that to the man of God, and he will give us directions about our way.
    ---------------------Page 511---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 9:9 (In the past in Israel, when a man went to get directions from God, he said, Come let
    us go to the Seer, for he who now is named Prophet was in those days given the name of Seer.)

    1 </br></br>Samuel 9:10 Then Saul said to his servant, You have said well; come, let us go. So they went to
    the town where the man of God was.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 9:11 And when they were on the way up to the town, they saw some young girls going
    out to get water and said to them, Is the seer here?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 9:12 And they said, He is; in fact he is before you: go quickly now, for he has come into
    the town today, for the people are making an offering in the high place today:

    1 </br></br>Samuel 9:13 When you come into the town you will see him straight away, before he goes up to
    the high place for the feast: the people are waiting for his blessing before starting the feast, and
    after that the guests will take part in it. So go up now and you will see him.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 9:14 So they went up to the town, and when they came inside the town, </br></br>Samuel came
    face to face with them on his way to the high place.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 9:15 Now the day before Saul came, the word of God had come to </br></br>Samuel, saying,

    1 </br></br>Samuel 9:16 Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, and on
    him you are to put the holy oil, making him ruler over my people Israel, and he will make my
    people safe from the hands of the Philistines: for I have seen the sorrow of my people, whose cry
    has come up to me.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 9:17 And when </br></br>Samuel saw Saul, the Lord said to him, This is the man of whom I gave
    you word! he it is who is to have authority over my people.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 9:18 Then Saul came up to </br></br>Samuel in the doorway of the town and said, Give me
    directions, if you will be so good, to the house of the seer.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 9:19 Then </br></br>Samuel said to Saul, I am the seer; go up before me to the high place and take
    food with me today: and in the morning I will let you go, after opening to you all the secrets of your
    heart.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 9:20 As for your asses which have been wandering for three days, give no thought to
    them, for they have come back. And for whom are all the desired things in Israel? are they not for
    you and your father's family?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 9:21 And Saul said, Am I not a man of Benjamin, the smallest of all the tribes of Israel?
    and my family the least of the families of Benjamin? why then do you say these words to me?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 9:22 Then </br></br>Samuel took Saul and his servant into the guest room, and made them take the
    chief place among all the guests who were there, about thirty persons.
    ---------------------Page 512---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 9:23 And </br></br>Samuel said to the cook, Give me that part which I gave you orders to keep by
    you.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 9:24 And the cook took up the leg with the fat tail on it, and put it before Saul. And
    </br></br>Samuel said, This is the part which has been kept for you: take it as your part of the feast; because
    it has been kept for you till the right time came and till the guests were present. So that day Saul
    took food with </br></br>Samuel.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 9:25 And when they had come down from the high place into the town, where a bed was
    made ready for Saul, he went to rest.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 9:26 And about dawn </br></br>Samuel said to Saul on the roof, Get up so that I may send you
    away. So Saul got up, and he and </br></br>Samuel went out together.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 9:27 And on their way down to the end of the town, </br></br>Samuel said to Saul, Give your
    servant orders to go on in front of us, (so he went on,) but you keep here, so that I may give you the
    word of God.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 10

    1 </br></br>Samuel 10:1 Then </br></br>Samuel took the bottle of oil, and put the oil on his head and gave him a kiss
    and said, Is not the Lord with the holy oil making you ruler over Israel, his people? and you will
    have authority over the people of the Lord, and you will make them safe from the hands of their
    attackers round about them, and this will be the sign for you:

    1 </br></br>Samuel 10:2 When you have gone away from me today, you will see two men by the resting-
    place of Rachel's body, in the land of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say to you, The asses
    which you went in search of have come back, and now your father, caring no longer for the asses, is
    troubled about you, saying, What am I to do about my son?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 10:3 Then you are to go on from there, and when you come to the oak-tree of Tabor, you
    will see three men going up to God to Beth-el, one having with him three young goats and another
    three cakes of bread and another a skin full of wine:

    1 </br></br>Samuel 10:4 They will say, Peace be with you, and will give you two cakes of bread, which you
    are to take from them.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 10:5 After that you will come to Gibeah, the hill of God, where an armed force of the
    Philistines is stationed: and when you come to the town, you will see a band of prophets coming
    down from the high place with instruments of music before them; and they will be acting like
    prophets:

    1 </br></br>Samuel 10:6 And the spirit of the Lord will come on you with power, and you will be acting like
    a prophet with them, and will be changed into another man.
    ---------------------Page 513---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 10:7 And when these signs come to you, see that you take the chance which is offered
    you; for God is with you.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 10:8 Then you are to go down before me to Gilgal, where I will come to you, for the
    offering of burned offerings and peace-offerings: go on waiting there for seven days till I come to
    you and make clear to you what you have to do.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 10:9 And it came about, that when he went away from </br></br>Samuel, God gave him a changed
    heart: and all those signs took place that day.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 10:10 And when they came to Gibeah, a band of prophets came face to face with him;
    and the spirit of God came on him with power and he took his place among them as a prophet.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 10:11 Now when Saul's old friends saw him among the band of prophets, the people said
    to one another, What has come to Saul, the son of Kish? Is even Saul among the prophets?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 10:12 And one of the people of that place said in answer, And who is their father? So it
    became a common saying, Is even Saul among the prophets?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 10:13 Then going away from the prophets, he came to the house.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 10:14 And Saul's father's brother said to him and his servant, Where have you been? And
    he said, Searching for the asses: and when we saw no sign of them, we came to </br></br>Samuel.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 10:15 Then he said, And what did </br></br>Samuel say to you?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 10:16 And Saul, answering him, said, He gave us word that the asses had come back. But
    he said nothing to him of </br></br>Samuel's words about the kingdom.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 10:17 Then </br></br>Samuel sent for the people to come together before the Lord at Mizpah;

    1 </br></br>Samuel 10:18 And he said to the children of Israel, The Lord, the God of Israel, has said, I took
    Israel out of Egypt, and made you free from the hands of the Egyptians and from all the kingdoms
    which kept you down:

    1 </br></br>Samuel 10:19 But today you are turned away from your God, who himself has been your saviour
    from all your troubles and sorrows; and you have said to him, Put a king over us. So now, take your
    places before the Lord by your tribes and by your thousands.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 10:20 So </br></br>Samuel made all the tribes of Israel come near, and the tribe of Benjamin was
    taken.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 10:21 Then he made the tribe of Benjamin come near by families, and the family of the
    Matrites was taken: and from them, Saul, the son of Kish, was taken: but when they went in search
    of him he was nowhere to be seen.
    ---------------------Page 514---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 10:22 So they put another question to the Lord, Is the man present here? And the answer
    of the Lord was, He is keeping himself from view among the goods.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 10:23 So they went quickly and made him come out; and when he took his place among
    the people, he was taller by a head than any of the people.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 10:24 And </br></br>Samuel said to all the people, Do you see the man of the Lord's selection,
    how there is no other like him among all the people? And all the people with loud cries said, Long
    life to the king!

    1 </br></br>Samuel 10:25 Then </br></br>Samuel gave the people the laws of the kingdom, writing them in a book
    which he put in a safe place before the Lord. And </br></br>Samuel sent all the people away, every man to
    his house.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 10:26 And Saul went to Gibeah, to his house; and with him went the men of war whose
    hearts had been touched by God.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 10:27 But certain good-for-nothing persons said, How is this man to be our saviour? And
    having no respect for him, they gave him no offering.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 11

    1 </br></br>Samuel 11:1 Then about a month after this, Nahash the Ammonite came up and put his forces in
    position for attacking Jabesh-gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, Make an agreement
    with us and we will be your servants.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 11:2 And Nahash the Ammonite said to them, I will make an agreement with you on this
    condition, that all your right eyes are put out; so that I may make it a cause of shame to all Israel.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 11:3 Then the responsible men of Jabesh said to him, Give us seven days, so that we may
    send men to every part of Israel: and then, if no one comes to our help, we will come out to you.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 11:4 So they sent representatives to Saul's town Gibeah, and these gave the news to the
    people: and all the people gave themselves to weeping.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 11:5 Now Saul came from the field, driving the oxen before him; and he said, Why are
    the people weeping? And they gave him word of what the men of Jabesh had said.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 11:6 And at their words, the spirit of God came on Saul with power, and he became very
    angry.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 11:7 And he took two oxen and, cutting them up, sent them through all the land of Israel
    by the hand of runners, saying, If any man does not come out after Saul and </br></br>Samuel, this will be
    done to his oxen. And the fear of the Lord came on the people and they came out like one man.
    ---------------------Page 515---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 11:8 And he had them numbered in Bezek: the children of Israel were three hundred
    thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 11:9 Then he said to the representatives who had come, Say to the men of Jabesh-gilead,
    Tomorrow, by the time the sun is high, you will be made safe. And the representatives came and
    gave the news to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 11:10 So the men of Jabesh said, Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you may do to
    us whatever seems good to you.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 11:11 Now on the day after, Saul put the people into three bands, and in the morning
    watch they came to the tents of the Ammonites, and they went on attacking them till the heat of the
    day: and those who were not put to death were put to flight in every direction, so that no two of
    them were together.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 11:12 And the people said to </br></br>Samuel, Who was it who said, Is Saul to be our king? give
    the men up, so that we may put them to death.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 11:13 And Saul said, Not a man is to be put to death today: for today the Lord has made
    Israel safe.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 11:14 Then </br></br>Samuel said to the people, Come, let us go to Gilgal and there make the
    kingdom strong in the hands of Saul.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 11:15 So all the people went to Gilgal; and there in Gilgal they made Saul king before
    the Lord; and peace-offerings were offered before the Lord; and there Saul and all the men of Israel
    were glad with great joy.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 12

    1 </br></br>Samuel 12:1 And </br></br>Samuel said to all Israel, You see that I have given ear to everything you said
    to me, and have made a king over you.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 12:2 And now, see, the king is before you: and I am old and grey-headed, and my sons
    are with you: I have been living before your eyes from my early days till now.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 12:3 Here I am: give witness against me before the Lord and before the man on whom he
    has put the holy oil: whose ox or ass have I taken? to whom have I been untrue? who has been
    crushed down by me? from whose hand have I taken a price for the blinding of my eyes? I will give
    it all back to you.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 12:4 And they said, You have never been untrue to us or cruel to us; you have taken
    nothing from any man.
    ---------------------Page 516---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 12:5 Then he said, The Lord is witness against you, and the man on whom he has put the
    holy oil is witness this day that you have seen no wrong in me. And they said, He is witness.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 12:6 And </br></br>Samuel said to the people, The Lord is witness, who gave authority to Moses
    and Aaron, and who took your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 12:7 Keep your places now, while I take up the argument with you before the Lord, and
    give you the story of the righteousness of the Lord, which he has made clear by his acts to you and
    to your fathers.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 12:8 When Jacob and his sons had come into Egypt, and were crushed by the Egyptians,
    the prayers of your fathers came up to the Lord, and the Lord sent Moses and Aaron, who took your
    fathers out of Egypt, and he put them into this place.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 12:9 But they were false to the Lord their God, and he gave them up into the hands of
    Sisera, captain of the army of Jabin, king of Hazor, and into the hands of the Philistines, and into
    the hands of the king of Moab, who made war against them.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 12:10 Then crying out to the Lord, they said, We have done evil, because we have been
    turned away from the Lord, worshipping the Baals and the Astartes: but now, make us safe from
    those who are against us and we will be your servants.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 12:11 So the Lord sent Jerubbaal and Barak and Jephthah and </br></br>Samuel and took you out
    of the power of those who were fighting against you on every side, and made you safe.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 12:12 And when you saw that Nahash, the king of the Ammonites, was coming against
    you, you said to me, No more of this; we will have a king for our ruler: when the Lord your God
    was your king.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 12:13 Here, then, is the king marked out by you: the Lord has put a king over you.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 12:14 If in the fear of the Lord you are his servants, hearing his voice and not going
    against the orders of the Lord, but being true to the Lord your God, you and the king ruling over
    you, then all will be well:

    1 </br></br>Samuel 12:15 But if you do not give ear to the voice of the Lord, but go against his orders, then
    the hand of the Lord will be against you and against your king for your destruction, as it was
    against your fathers.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 12:16 Now keep where you are and see this great thing which the Lord will do before
    your eyes.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 12:17 Is it not now the time of the grain cutting? My cry will go up to the Lord and he
    will send thunder and rain: so that you may see and be conscious of your great sin which you have
    done in the eyes of the Lord in desiring a king for yourselves.
    ---------------------Page 517---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 12:18 So </br></br>Samuel made prayer to the Lord; and the Lord sent thunder and rain that day:
    and all the people were in fear of the Lord and of </br></br>Samuel.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 12:19 And all the people said to </br></br>Samuel, Make prayer for us to the Lord your God so
    that death may not overtake us: for in addition to all our sins we have done this evil, in desiring a
    king.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 12:20 Then </br></br>Samuel said to the people, Have no fear: truly you have done evil, but do not
    be turned away from the Lord; be his servants with all your heart;

    1 </br></br>Samuel 12:21 And do not go from the right way turning to those false gods in which there is no
    profit and no salvation, for they are false.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 12:22 For the Lord will not give his people up, because of the honour of his name; for it
    was the Lord's pleasure to make of you a people for himself.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 12:23 And as for me, never will I go against the orders of the Lord by giving up my
    prayers for you: but I will go on teaching you the good and right way.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 12:24 Only go in the fear of the Lord, and be his true servants with all your heart,
    keeping in mind what great things he has done for you.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 12:25 But if you still do evil, destruction will overtake you and your king.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 13

    1 </br></br>Samuel 13:1 ***

    1 </br></br>Samuel 13:2 And Saul took for himself three thousand men of Israel, of whom he kept two
    thousand with him in Michmash and in the mountain of Beth-el, and a thousand were with Jonathan
    in Gibeah in the land of Benjamin: the rest of the people he sent back to their tents.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 13:3 And Jonathan made an attack on the armed force of the Philistines stationed at
    Gibeah; and news was given to the Philistines that the Hebrews were turned against them. And Saul
    had a horn sounded through all the land,

    1 </br></br>Samuel 13:4 And all Israel had the news that Saul had made an attack on the Philistines, and that
    Israel was bitterly hated by the Philistines. And the people came together after Saul to Gilgal.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 13:5 And the Philistines came together to make war on Israel, three thousand war-
    carriages and six thousand horsemen and an army of people like the sands of the sea in number:
    they came up and took up their position in Michmash, to the east of Beth-aven.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 13:6 When the men of Israel saw the danger they were in, (for the people were troubled,)
    they took cover in cracks in the hillsides and in the woods and in rocks and holes and hollows.
    ---------------------Page 518---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 13:7 And a great number of the people had gone over Jordan to the land of Gad and
    Gilead; but Saul was still in Gilgal, and all the people went after him shaking in fear.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 13:8 And he went on waiting there for seven days, the time fixed by </br></br>Samuel: but </br></br>Samuel
    did not come to Gilgal; and the people were starting to go away from him.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 13:9 Then Saul said, Come here and give me the burned offering and the peace-
    offerings. And he made a burned offering to the Lord.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 13:10 And when the burned offering was ended, </br></br>Samuel came; and Saul went out to see
    him and to give him a blessing.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 13:11 And </br></br>Samuel said, What have you done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the
    people were going away from me, and you had not come at the time which had been fixed, and the
    Philistines had come together at Michmash;

    1 </br></br>Samuel 13:12 I said, Now the Philistines will come down on me at Gilgal, and I have made no
    prayer for help to the Lord: and so, forcing myself to do it, I made a burned offering.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 13:13 And </br></br>Samuel said to Saul, You have done a foolish thing: you have not kept the
    rules which the Lord your God gave you; it was the purpose of the Lord to make your authority
    over Israel safe for ever.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 13:14 But now, your authority will not go on: the Lord, searching for a man who is
    pleasing to him in every way, has given him the place of ruler over his people, because you have
    not done what the Lord gave you orders to do.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 13:15 Then </br></br>Samuel went up from Gilgal and the rest of the people went up after Saul
    against the men of war, and they came from Gilgal to Gibeah in the land of Benjamin: and Saul
    took the number of the people who were with him, about six hundred men.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 13:16 And Saul, with Jonathan his son and the people who were with them, was waiting
    in Geba in the land of Benjamin: but the tents of the Philistines were in Michmash.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 13:17 And three bands of men came out from the Philistines to make an attack; one band
    went by the road which goes to Ophrah, into the land of Shual:

    1 </br></br>Samuel 13:18 And another went in the direction of Beth-horon: and another went by the hill
    looking down on the valley of Zeboiim, in the direction of the waste land.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 13:19 Now there was no iron-worker in all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, For
    fear the Hebrews make themselves swords or spears:

    1 </br></br>Samuel 13:20 But all the Israelites had to go to the Philistines to get their ploughs and blades and
    axes and hooks made sharp;
    ---------------------Page 519---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 13:21 For they had instruments for putting an edge on their ploughs and blades and forks
    and axes, and for putting iron points on their ox-driving rods.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 13:22 So on the day of the fight at Michmash, not a sword or a spear was to be seen in
    the hands of any of the people with Saul and Jonathan: only Saul and his son Jonathan had them.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 13:23 And the armed force of the Philistines went out to the narrow way of Michmash.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:1 Now one day Jonathan, the son of Saul, said to the young man who was with him,
    looking after his arms, Come, let us go over to the Philistine force over there. But he said nothing to
    his father.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:2 And Saul was still waiting in the farthest part of Geba, under the fruit-tree in
    Migron: there were about six hundred men with him;

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:3 And Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, brother of Ichabod, the son of Phinehas, the son of
    Eli, the priest of the Lord in Shiloh, who had the ephod. And the people had no idea that Jonathan
    had gone.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:4 Now between the narrow roads over the mountains by which Jonathan was making
    his way to the Philistines' forces, there was a sharp overhanging rock on one side, and a sharp rock
    on the other side: one was named Bozez and the other Seneh.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:5 The one rock went up on the north in front of Michmash and the other on the south
    in front of Geba.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:6 And Jonathan said to his young servant who had his arms, Come, let us go over to
    the armies of these men who have no circumcision: it may be that the Lord will give us help, for
    there is no limit to his power; the Lord is able to give salvation by a great army or by a small band.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:7 And his servant said to him, Do whatever is in your mind: see, I am with you in
    every impulse of your heart.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:8 Then Jonathan said, Now we will go over to these men and let them see us.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:9 If they say to us, Keep quiet where you are till we come to you; then we will keep
    our places and not go up to them.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:10 But if they say, Come up to us; then we will go up, for the Lord has given them
    into our hands: and this will be the sign to us.
    ---------------------Page 520---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:11 And they let the Philistine force see the two of them: and the Philistines said,
    Look! the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have taken cover.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:12 And the armed men of the force gave Jonathan and his servant their answer,
    saying, Come up here to us, and we will let you see something. Then Jonathan said to his servant,
    Come up after me: for the Lord has given them up into the hands of Israel.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:13 And Jonathan went up, gripping with his hands and his feet, his servant going up
    after him; and the Philistines gave way before Jonathan when he made an attack on them, and his
    servant put them to death after him.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:14 And at their first attack, Jonathan and his servant put to the sword about twenty
    men, all inside the space of half an acre of land.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:15 And there was great fear in the tents and in the field and among all the men of the
    armed force, and the attackers were shaking with fear; even the earth was moved with a great
    shaking and there was a fear as from God.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:16 And the watchmen of Saul, looking out from Geba in the land of Benjamin, saw
    all the army flowing away and running here and there.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:17 Then Saul said to the people who were with him, Let everyone be numbered and
    let us see who has gone from us. And when they had been numbered, it was seen that Jonathan and
    his servant were not there.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:18 And Saul said to Ahijah, Let the ephod come here. For he went before Israel with
    the ephod at that time.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:19 Now while Saul was talking to the priest, the noise in the tents of the Philistines
    became louder and louder; and Saul said to the priest, Take back your hand.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:20 And Saul and all the people with him came together and went forward to the fight:
    and every man's sword was turned against the man at his side, and there was a very great noise.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:21 Then the Hebrews who had been with the Philistines for some time, and had gone
    up with them to their tents, turning round were joined to those who were with Saul and Jonathan.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:22 And all the men of Israel who had taken cover in the hill-country of Ephraim,
    hearing that the Philistines had been put to flight, went after them, attacking them.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:23 So the Lord made Israel safe that day: and the fight went over to Beth-aven.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:24 And all the people were with Saul, about twenty thousand men, and the fight was
    general through all the hill-country of Ephraim; but Saul made a great error that day, by putting the
    people under an oath, saying, Let that man be cursed who takes food before evening comes and I
    have given punishment to those who are against me. So the people had not a taste of food.
    ---------------------Page 521---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:25 And there was honey on the face of the field, and all the people came to the honey,
    the bees having gone from it;

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:26 But not a man put his hand to his mouth for fear of the curse.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:27 But Jonathan, having no knowledge of the oath his father had put on the people,
    stretching out the rod which was in his hand, put the end of it in the honey, and put it to his mouth;
    then his eyes were made bright.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:28 Then one of the people said to him, Your father put the people under an oath,
    saying, Let that man be cursed who takes any food this day. And the people were feeble, needing
    food.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:29 Then Jonathan said, My father has made trouble come on the land: now see how
    bright my eyes have become because I have taken a little of this honey.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:30 How much more if the people had freely taken their food from the goods of those
    who were fighting against them! would there not have been much greater destruction among the
    Philistines?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:31 That day they overcame the Philistines from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people
    were feeble from need of food.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:32 And rushing at the goods taken in the fight, the people took oxen and sheep and
    young oxen, and put them to death there on the earth, and had a meal, taking the flesh with the
    blood in it.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:33 Then it was said to Saul, See, the people are sinning against the Lord, taking the
    blood with the flesh. And he said to those who gave him the news, Now let a great stone be rolled
    to me here.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:34 And Saul said, Go about among the people and say to them, Let every man come
    here to me with his ox and his sheep, and put them to death here, and take his meal: do no sin
    against the Lord by taking the blood with the flesh. So all the people took their oxen with them that
    night and put them to death there.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:35 And Saul put up an altar to the Lord: this was the first altar which he put up to the
    Lord.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:36 And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, attacking them till the
    morning, till there is not a man of them living. And they said, Do whatever seems right to you.
    Then the priest said, Let us come near to God.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:37 And Saul, desiring directions from God, said, Am I to go down after the
    Philistines? will you give them up into the hands of Israel? But he gave him no answer that day.
    ---------------------Page 522---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:38 And Saul said, Come near, all you chiefs of the people, and let us get word from
    God and see in whom is this sin today.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:39 For, by the living Lord, the saviour of Israel, even if the sinner is Jonathan, my
    son, death will certainly be his fate. But not a man among all the people gave him any answer.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:40 Then he said to all Israel, You be on one side, and I with Jonathan my son will be
    on the other side. And the people said to Saul, Do whatever seems good to you.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:41 Then Saul said to the Lord, the God of Israel, Why have you not given me an
    answer today? If the sin is in me or in Jonathan my son, O Lord God of Israel, give Urim, and if it
    is in your people Israel, give Thummim. And by the decision of the Lord, Saul and Jonathan were
    marked out, and the people went free.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:42 And Saul said, Give your decision between my son Jonathan and me. And
    Jonathan was taken.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:43 Then Saul said to Jonathan, Give me an account of what you have done. And
    Jonathan gave him the story and said, Certainly I took a little honey on the end of my rod; and now
    death is to be my fate.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:44 And Saul said, May God's punishment be on me if death is not your fate, Jonathan.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:45 And the people said to Saul, Is death to come to Jonathan, the worker of this great
    salvation for Israel? Let it not be so: by the living Lord, not one hair of his head is to be touched,
    for he has been working with God today. So the people kept Jonathan from death.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:46 Then Saul, turning back, went after the Philistines no longer: and the Philistines
    went back to their place.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:47 Now when Saul had taken his place as ruler of Israel, he made war on those who
    were against him on every side, Moab and the Ammonites and Edom and the kings of Zobah and
    the Philistines: and whichever way he went, he overcame them.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:48 And he did great things, and overcame the Amalekites, and made Israel safe from
    the hands of their attackers.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:49 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan and Ishvi and Malchi-shua; and these are the
    names of his daughters: the older was named Merab and the younger Michal;

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:50 The name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz; the captain of his
    army was Abner, the son of Ner, brother of Saul's father.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:51 Kish, the father of Saul, and Ner, the father of Abner, were sons of Abiel.
    ---------------------Page 523---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 14:52 All through the life of Saul there was bitter war against the Philistines; and
    whenever Saul saw any strong man or any good fighting man, he kept him near himself.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:1 And </br></br>Samuel said to Saul, The Lord sent me to put the holy oil on you and to make
    you king over his people, over Israel: so give ear now to the words of the Lord.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:2 The Lord of armies says, I will give punishment to Amalek for what he did to
    Israel, fighting against him on the way when Israel came out of Egypt.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:3 Go now and put Amalek to the sword, putting to the curse all they have, without
    mercy: put to death every man and woman, every child and baby at the breast, every ox and sheep,
    camel and ass.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:4 And Saul sent for the people and had them numbered in Telaim, two hundred
    thousand footmen and ten thousand men of Judah.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:5 And Saul came to the town of Amalek, and took up his position in the valley
    secretly.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:6 And Saul said to the Kenites, Go away, take yourselves out from among the
    Amalekites, or destruction will overtake you with them: for you were kind to the children of Israel
    when they came out of Egypt. So the Kenites went away from among the Amalekites.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:7 And Saul made an attack on the Amalekites from Havilah on the road to Shur,
    which is before Egypt.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:8 He took Agag, king of the Amalekites, prisoner, and put all the people to the sword
    without mercy.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:9 But Saul and the people did not put Agag to death, and they kept the best of the
    sheep and the oxen and the fat beasts and the lambs, and whatever was good, not desiring to put
    them to the curse: but everything which was bad and of no use they put to the curse.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:10 Then the Lord said to </br></br>Samuel,

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:11 It is no longer my pleasure for Saul to be king; for he is turned back from going in
    my ways, and has not done my orders. And </br></br>Samuel was very sad, crying to the Lord in prayer all
    night.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:12 And early in the morning he got up and went to Saul; and word was given to
    </br></br>Samuel that Saul had come to Carmel and put up a pillar, and had gone from there down to Gilgal.
    ---------------------Page 524---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:13 And </br></br>Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said to him, May the blessing of the Lord be
    with you: I have done what was ordered by the Lord.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:14 And </br></br>Samuel said, What then is this sound of the crying of sheep and the noise of
    oxen which comes to my ears?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:15 And Saul said, They have taken them from the Amalekites: for the people have
    kept the best of the sheep and of the oxen as an offering to the Lord your God; all the rest we have
    given up to destruction.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:16 Then </br></br>Samuel said to Saul, Say no more! Let me give you word of what the Lord
    has said to me this night. And he said to him, Say on.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:17 And </br></br>Samuel said, Though you may seem little to yourself, are you not head of the
    tribes of Israel? for the Lord with the holy oil made you king over Israel,

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:18 And the Lord sent you on a journey and said, Go and put to the curse those
    sinners, the Amalekites, fighting against them till every one is dead.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:19 Why then did you not do the orders of the Lord, but by violently taking their goods
    did evil in the eyes of the Lord?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:20 And Saul said, Truly, I have done the orders of the Lord and have gone the way
    the Lord sent me; I have taken Agag, the king of Amalek, and have given the Amalekites up to
    destruction.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:21 But the people took some of their goods, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things
    which were put to the curse, to make an offering of them to the Lord your God in Gilgal.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:22 And </br></br>Samuel said, Has the Lord as much delight in offerings and burned offerings
    as in the doing of his orders? Truly, to do his pleasure is better than to make offerings, and to give
    ear to him than the fat of sheep.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:23 For to go against his orders is like the sin of those who make use of secret arts, and
    pride is like giving worship to images. Because you have put away from you the word of the Lord,
    he has put you from your place as king.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:24 And Saul said to </br></br>Samuel, Great is my sin: for I have gone against the orders of the
    Lord and against your words: because, fearing the people, I did what they said.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:25 So now, let my sin have forgiveness, and go back with me to give worship to the
    Lord.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:26 And </br></br>Samuel said to Saul, I will not go back with you: for you have put away from
    you the word of the Lord, and the Lord has put you from your place as king over Israel.
    ---------------------Page 525---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:27 And when </br></br>Samuel was turning round to go away, Saul took the skirt of his robe in
    his hand, and the cloth came away.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:28 And </br></br>Samuel said to him, The Lord has taken away the kingdom of Israel from you
    this day by force, and has given it to a neighbour of yours who is better than you.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:29 And further, the Glory of Israel will not say what is false, and his purpose may not
    be changed: for he is not a man, whose purpose may be changed.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:30 Then he said, Great is my sin: but still, give me honour now before the heads of
    my people and before Israel, and come back with me so that I may give worship to the Lord your
    God.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:31 So </br></br>Samuel went back after Saul, and Saul gave worship to the Lord.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:32 Then </br></br>Samuel said, Make Agag, the king of the Amalekites, come here to me. And
    Agag came to him shaking with fear. And Agag said, Truly the pain of death is past.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:33 And </br></br>Samuel said, As your sword has made women without children, so now your
    mother will be without children among women. And Agag was cut up by </br></br>Samuel, bone from bone,
    before the Lord in Gilgal.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:34 Then </br></br>Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house in Gibeah, in the land
    of Saul.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 15:35 And </br></br>Samuel never saw Saul again till the day of his death; but </br></br>Samuel was
    sorrowing for Saul: and it was no longer the Lord's pleasure for Saul to be king over Israel.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 16

    1 </br></br>Samuel 16:1 And the Lord said to </br></br>Samuel, How long will you go on sorrowing for Saul, seeing
    that I have put him from his place as king over Israel? Take oil in your vessel and go; I will send
    you to Jesse, the Beth-lehemite: for I have got a king for myself among his sons.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 16:2 And </br></br>Samuel said, How is it possible for me to go? If Saul gets news of it he will put
    me to death. And the Lord said, Take a young cow with you and say, I have come to make an
    offering to the Lord.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 16:3 And send for Jesse to be present at the offering, and I will make clear to you what
    you are to do: and you are to put the holy oil on him whose name I give you.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 16:4 And </br></br>Samuel did as the Lord said and came to Beth-lehem. And the responsible men
    of the town came out to him in fear and said, Do you come in peace?
    ---------------------Page 526---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 16:5 And he said, In peace: I have come to make an offering to the Lord: make
    yourselves clean and come with me to make the offering. And he made Jesse and his sons clean,
    and sent for them to be present at the offering.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 16:6 Now when they came, looking at Eliab, he said, Clearly the man of the Lord's
    selection is before him.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 16:7 But the Lord said to </br></br>Samuel, Do not take note of his face or how tall he is, because I
    will not have him: for the Lord's view is not man's; man takes note of the outer form, but the Lord
    sees the heart.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 16:8 Then Jesse sent for Abinadab and made him come before </br></br>Samuel. And he said, The
    Lord has not taken this one.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 16:9 Then Jesse made Shammah come before him. And he said, The Lord has not taken
    this one.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 16:10 And Jesse made his seven sons come before </br></br>Samuel. And </br></br>Samuel said to Jesse,
    The Lord has not taken any of these.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 16:11 Then </br></br>Samuel said to Jesse, Are all your children here? And he said, There is still
    the youngest, and he is looking after the sheep. And </br></br>Samuel said to Jesse, Send and make him
    come here: for we will not take our seats till he is here.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 16:12 So he sent and made him come in. Now he had red hair and beautiful eyes and
    pleasing looks. And the Lord said, Come, put the oil on him, for this is he.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 16:13 Then </br></br>Samuel took the bottle of oil, and put the oil on him there among his
    brothers: and from that day the spirit of the Lord came on David with power. So </br></br>Samuel went back
    to Ramah.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 16:14 Now the spirit of the Lord had gone from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord
    was troubling him.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 16:15 And Saul's servants said to him, See now, an evil spirit from God is troubling you.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 16:16 Now give orders to your servants who are here before you to go in search of a man
    who is an expert player on a corded instrument: and it will be that when the evil spirit from God is
    on you, he will make music for you on his instrument, and you will get well.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 16:17 And Saul said to his servants, Then get me a man who is an expert player, and
    make him come to me.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 16:18 Then one of the servants in answer said, I have seen a son of Jesse, the Beth-
    lehemite, who is expert at playing, and a strong man and a man of war; and he is wise in his words,
    and pleasing in looks, and the Lord is with him.
    ---------------------Page 527---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 16:19 So Saul sent his servants to Jesse and said, Send me your son David who is with
    the sheep.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 16:20 And Jesse took five cakes of bread and a skin of wine and a young goat and sent
    them to Saul by David.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 16:21 And David came to Saul, waiting before him: and he became very dear to Saul,
    who made him his servant, giving him the care of his arms.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 16:22 And Saul sent to Jesse saying, Let David be with me, for he is pleasing to me.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 16:23 And whenever the evil spirit from God came on Saul, David took his instrument
    and made music: so new life came to Saul, and he got well, and the evil spirit went away from him.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:1 Now the Philistines got their armies together for war, and came together at Socoh in
    the land of Judah, and took up their position between Socoh and Azekah in Ephes-dammim.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:2 And Saul and the men of Israel came together and took up their position in the
    valley of Elah, and put their forces in order against the Philistines.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:3 The Philistines were stationed on the mountain on one side and Israel on the
    mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:4 And a fighter came out from the tents of the Philistines, named Goliath of Gath; he
    was more than six cubits tall.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:5 And he had a head-dress of brass on his head, and he was dressed in a coat of metal,
    the weight of which was five thousand shekels of brass.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:6 His legs were covered with plates of brass and hanging on his back was a javelin of
    brass.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:7 The stem of his spear was as long as a cloth-worker's rod, and its head was made of
    six hundred shekels' weight of iron: and one went before him with his body-cover.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:8 He took up his position and in a loud voice said to the armies of Israel, Why have
    you come out to make war? Am I not a Philistine and you servants of Saul? Send out a man for
    yourselves and let him come down to me.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:9 If he is able to have a fight with me and overcome me, then we will be your
    servants: but if I am able to overcome him, then you will be our servants and do work for us.
    ---------------------Page 528---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:10 And the Philistine said, I have put to shame the armies of Israel this day; give me a
    man so that we may have a fight together.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:11 And Saul and all Israel, hearing those words of the Philistine, were troubled and
    full of fear.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:12 Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem-judah named Jesse, who
    had eight sons; and he was an old man in Saul's day, and far on in years.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:13 And the three oldest sons of Jesse had gone with Saul to the fight: the names of the
    three who went to the fight were Eliab, the oldest, and Abinadab the second, and Shammah the
    third.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:14 And David was the youngest: and the three oldest were with Saul's army.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:15 Now David went to and from Saul, looking after his father's sheep at Beth-lehem.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:16 And the Philistine came near every morning and evening for forty days.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:17 And Jesse said to his son David, Take now for your brothers an ephah of this dry
    grain and these ten cakes of bread, and go quickly with them to the tents to your brothers;

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:18 And take these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand, and see how your
    brothers are and come back with a sign to say how they are.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:19 Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel were in the valley of Elah, fighting
    with the Philistines.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:20 And David got up early in the morning, and, giving the sheep into the care of a
    keeper, took the things and went as Jesse had said; and he came to the lines where the carts were,
    when the army was going out to the fight giving their war-cry.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:21 And Israel and the Philistines had put their forces in position, army against army.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:22 And David gave his parcels into the hands of the keeper of the army stores, and
    went running to the army and came to his brothers to get knowledge about them.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:23 And while he was talking to them, the fighter, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by
    name, came out from the Philistines' lines and said the same words, in David's hearing.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:24 And all the men of Israel, when they saw him, went in flight, overcome with fear.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:25 And the men of Israel said, Have you seen this man? Clearly he has come out to
    put shame on Israel: and it is certain that if any man overcomes him, the king will give that man
    great wealth, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's family free in Israel.
    ---------------------Page 529---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:26 And David said to the men near him, What will be done to the man who
    overcomes this Philistine and takes away the shame from Israel? for who is this Philistine, a man
    without circumcision, that he has put shame on the armies of the living God?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:27 And the people gave him this answer, So it will be done to the man who
    overcomes him.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:28 And Eliab, his oldest brother, hearing what David said to the men, was moved to
    wrath against David, and said, Why have you come here? Into whose care have you given that little
    flock of sheep in the waste land? I have knowledge of your pride and the evil of your heart, you
    have come down to see the fight.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:29 And David said, What have I done now? was it not only a word?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:30 And turning away from him to one of the other men, he said the same words: and
    the people gave him the same answer.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:31 And, hearing what David said, they gave Saul word of it: and he sent for him.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:32 And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart become feeble because of him; I, your
    servant, will go out and have a fight with this Philistine.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:33 And Saul said to David, You are not able to go out against this Philistine and have
    a fight with him: for you are only a boy, and he has been a man of war from his earliest days.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:34 And David said to Saul, Your servant has been keeper of his father's sheep; and if
    a lion or a bear came and took a lamb from the flock,

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:35 I went out after him, and overcame him, and took it out of his mouth: and if,
    turning on me, he came at me, I took him by the hair and overcame him and put him to death.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:36 Your servant has overcome lion and bear: and the fate of this Philistine, who is
    without circumcision, will be like theirs, seeing that he has put shame on the armies of the living
    God.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:37 And David said, The Lord, who kept me safe from the grip of the lion and the
    bear, will be my saviour from the hands of this Philistine. And Saul said to David, Go! and may the
    Lord be with you.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:38 Then Saul gave David his clothing of war, and put a head-dress of brass on his
    head and had him clothed with a coat of metal.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:39 And David took Saul's sword and put the band round him over the metal coat, and
    was unable to go forward; for he was not used to them. Then David said to Saul, It is not possible
    for me to go out with these, for I am not used to them. So David took them off.
    ---------------------Page 530---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:40 Then he took his stick in his hand, and got five smooth stones from the bed of the
    stream and put them in a bag such as is used by sheep-keepers; and in his hand was a leather band
    used for sending stones: and so he went in the direction of the Philistine.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:41 And the Philistine came nearer to David; and the man who had his body-cover
    went before him.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:42 And when the Philistine, taking note, saw David, he had a poor opinion of him: for
    he was only a boy, red-haired and good-looking.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:43 And the Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that you come out to me with sticks?
    And the Philistine put curses on David by all his gods.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:44 And the Philistine said to David, Come here to me, and I will give your flesh to the
    birds of the air and the beasts of the field.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:45 Then David said to the Philistine, You come to me with a sword and a spear and a
    javelin: but I come to you in the name of the Lord of armies, the God of the armies of Israel on
    which you have put shame.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:46 This day the Lord will give you up into my hands, and I will overcome you, and
    take your head off you; and I will give the bodies of the Philistine army to the birds of the air and
    the beasts of the earth today, so that all the earth may see that Israel has a God;

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:47 And all these people who are here today may see that the Lord does not give
    salvation by sword and spear: for the fight is the Lord's, and he will give you up into our hands.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:48 Now when the Philistine made a move and came near to David, David quickly
    went at a run in the direction of the army, meeting the Philistine face to face.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:49 And David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone and sent it from his leather
    band straight at the Philistine, and the stone went deep into his brow, and he went down to the
    earth, falling on his face.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:50 So David overcame the Philistine with his leather band and a stone, wounding the
    Philistine and causing his death: but David had no sword in his hand.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:51 So running up to the Philistine and putting his foot on him, David took his sword
    out of its cover, and put him to death, cutting off his head with it. And when the Philistines saw that
    their fighter was dead, they went in flight.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:52 And the men of Israel and of Judah got up, and gave a cry, and went after the
    Philistines as far as Gath and the town doors of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines were
    falling down by the road from Shaaraim all the way to Gath and Ekron.
    ---------------------Page 531---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:53 Then the children of Israel came back from going after the Philistines, and took
    their goods from the tents.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:54 And David took the head of the Philistine to Jerusalem, but the metal war-dress
    and the arms he put in his tent.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:55 And when Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the
    captain of the army, Abner, whose son is this young man? And Abner said, On your life, O king, I
    have no idea.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:56 And the king said, Make search and see whose son this young man is.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:57 And when David was coming back after the destruction of the Philistine, Abner
    took him to Saul, with the head of the Philistine in his hand.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 17:58 And Saul said to him, Young man, whose son are you? And David in answer said,
    I am the son of your servant Jesse of Beth-lehem.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:1 Now after David's talk with Saul was ended, the soul of Jonathan was joined with
    the soul of David, and David became as dear to him as his very life.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:2 And that day Saul took David and would not let him go back to his father's house.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:3 Then Jonathan and David made an agreement together, because of Jonathan's love
    for David.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:4 And Jonathan took off the robe he had on and gave it to David, with all his military
    dress, even to his sword and his bow and the band round his body.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:5 And David went wherever Saul sent him, and did wisely: and Saul put him at the
    head of his men of war, and this was pleasing to all the people as well as to Saul's servants.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:6 Now on their way, when David came back after the destruction of the Philistine, the
    women came out of all the towns of Israel, with songs and dances, meeting David with melody and
    joy and instruments of music.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:7 And the women, answering one another in their song, said, Saul has put to death his
    thousands and David his tens of thousands.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:8 And Saul was very angry and this saying was unpleasing to him; and he said, They
    have given David credit for tens of thousands, and to me for only thousands: what more is there for
    him but the kingdom?
    ---------------------Page 532---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:9 And from that day Saul was looking with envy on David.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:10 Now on the day after, an evil spirit from God came on Saul with great force and he
    was acting like a prophet among the men of his house, while David was making music for him, as
    he did day by day: and Saul had his spear in his hand.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:11 And Saul, balancing the spear in his hand, said, I will give David a blow, pinning
    him to the wall. And David got away from him twice.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:12 And Saul went in fear of David, because the Lord was with David and had gone
    away from Saul.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:13 So Saul sent him away, and made him a captain over a thousand; and he went
    about his business before the people.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:14 And in all his undertakings David did wisely; and the Lord was with him.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:15 And when Saul saw how wisely he did, he was in fear of him.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:16 But David was loved by all Israel and Judah, for he went out and came in before
    them.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:17 And Saul said to David, Here is my oldest daughter Merab, whom I will give you
    for your wife: only be strong for me, fighting in the Lord's wars. For Saul said, Let it not be through
    me that his fate comes to him, but through the Philistines.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:18 And David said to Saul, Who am I, and what is my father's family in Israel, that I
    am to be son-in-law to the king?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:19 But when the time came to give Merab, Saul's daughter, to David, she was given
    to Adriel of Meholath.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:20 And Saul's daughter Michal was in love with David: and Saul had word of it and
    was pleased.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:21 And Saul said, I will give her to him, so that she may be a cause of danger to him,
    and so that the hands of the Philistines may be against him. So Saul said to David, Today you are to
    become my son-in-law for the second time.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:22 And Saul gave his servants orders saying, Have talk with David secretly and say to
    him, See how the king has delight in you, and how you are loved by all his servants: then be the
    king's son-in-law.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:23 And Saul's servants said these things to David. And David said, Does it seem to
    you a small thing to be the king's son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, of no great name?
    ---------------------Page 533---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:24 And the servants of Saul gave him an account of what David had said.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:25 And Saul said, Then say to David, The king has no desire for any bride-price, but
    only for the private parts of a hundred Philistines so that the king may get the better of his haters.
    But it was in Saul's mind that David might come to his end by the hands of the Philistines.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:26 And when his servants said these words to David, he was well pleased to be the
    son-in-law of the king. And the days were still not past.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:27 So David and his men got up and went, and put to death two hundred of the
    Philistines; and David took their private parts and gave the full number of them to the king, so that
    he might be the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him his daughter Michal for his wife.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:28 And it was clear to Saul that the Lord was with David; and he was loved by all
    Israel.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:29 And Saul's fear of David became all the greater, and he went on hating him, day
    by day.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 18:30 Then the rulers of the Philistines went out to war: and whenever they went out,
    David did more wisely than all the other servants of Saul, so that his name became greatly
    honoured.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 19

    1 </br></br>Samuel 19:1 And Saul gave orders to his son Jonathan and to all his servants to put David to
    death. But Saul's son Jonathan had great delight in David.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 19:2 And Jonathan said to David, Saul, my father, is purposing your death: so now, take
    care in the morning, and keep yourself safe in a secret place:

    1 </br></br>Samuel 19:3 And I will go out and take my place by my father's side in the field near where you
    are; and I will get into talk with my father about you, and when I see how things are, I will give you
    word.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 19:4 And Jonathan gave his father Saul a good account of David, and said to him, Let
    not the king do wrong against his servant, against David; because he has done you no wrong, and
    all his acts have had a good outcome for you:

    1 </br></br>Samuel 19:5 For he put his life in danger and overcame the Philistine, and the Lord gave all
    Israel salvation: you saw it and were glad: why then are you sinning against him who has done no
    wrong, desiring the death of David without cause?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 19:6 And Saul gave ear to the voice of Jonathan, and said with an oath, By the living
    Lord, he is not to be put to death.
    ---------------------Page 534---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 19:7 Then Jonathan sent for David and gave him word of all these things. And Jonathan
    took David to Saul, who kept him by his side as in the past.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 19:8 And there was war again: and David went out fighting the Philistines, causing great
    destruction among them; and they went in flight before him.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 19:9 And an evil spirit from the Lord came on Saul, when he was seated in his house
    with his spear in his hand; and David made music for him.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 19:10 And Saul would have sent his spear through him, pinning him to the wall, but he
    got away and the spear went into the wall: and that night David went in flight and got away.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 19:11 Then in that night Saul sent men to David's house to keep watch on him so as to
    put him to death in the morning: and David's wife Michal said to him, If you do not go away to a
    safe place tonight you will be put to death in the morning.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 19:12 So Michal let David down through the window, and he went in flight and got
    away.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 19:13 Then Michal took the image and put it in the bed, with a cushion of goat's hair at
    its head, and she put clothing over it.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 19:14 And when Saul sent men to take David, she said, He is ill.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 19:15 And Saul sent his men to see David, saying, Do not come back without him, take
    him in his bed, so that I may put him to death.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 19:16 And when the men came in, there was the image in the bed, with the cushion of
    goat's hair at its head

    1 </br></br>Samuel 19:17 And Saul said to Michal, why have you been false to me, letting my hater go and
    get safely away? And in answer Michal said to Saul, He said to me, Let me go, or I will put you to
    death.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 19:18 So David went in flight and got away and came to Ramah, to </br></br>Samuel, and gave
    him an account of all Saul had done to him. And he and </br></br>Samuel went and were living in Naioth.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 19:19 And word was given to Saul that David was at Naioth in Ramah.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 19:20 And Saul sent men to take David; and when they saw the band of prophets at
    work, with </br></br>Samuel in his place at their head, the spirit of God came on Saul's men, and they
    became like prophets.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 19:21 And Saul, having news of this, sent other men, who in the same way became like
    prophets. And a third time Saul sent men, and they like the others became like prophets.
    ---------------------Page 535---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 19:22 Then he himself went to Ramah, and came to the great water-spring in Secu; and
    questioning the people he said, Where are </br></br>Samuel and David? And one said, They are at Naioth in
    Ramah.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 19:23 And he went on from there to Naioth in Ramah: and the spirit of God came on
    him, and he went on, acting like a prophet, till he came to Naioth in Ramah.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 19:24 And he took off his clothing, acting like a prophet before </br></br>Samuel, and falling
    down he was stretched out, without his clothing, all that day and all that night. This is the reason for
    the saying, Is even Saul among the prophets?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:1 And David went in flight from Naioth in Ramah and came to Jonathan and said,
    What have I done? What is my crime and my sin against your father that he is attempting to take
    my life?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:2 And he said to him, Far be the thought: you will not be put to death: see, my father
    does nothing, great or small, without giving me word of it: would he keep this secret from me? It is
    not so.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:3 But David took his oath again and said, Your father sees that I am dear to you; so he
    says to himself, Let Jonathan have no idea of this, for it will be a grief to him; but as the Lord is
    living, and as your soul is living, there is only a step between me and death.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:4 Then Jonathan said to David, Whatever your desire is, I will do it for you.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:5 And David said to Jonathan, Tomorrow is the new moon, and I will not be seated
    with the king at his table: but let me go to a safe place in the country till the evening.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:6 And if your father takes note of the fact that I am away, say, David made a request
    to me for himself that he might go to Beth-lehem, to his town: for it is the time when his family
    make their offering year by year.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:7 If he says, It is well, your servant will be at peace: but if he is angry, then it will be
    clear to you that he has an evil purpose in mind against me.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:8 So, then, be kind to your servant; for you have been united with your servant in an
    agreement made before the Lord: but if there is any wrongdoing in me, put me to death yourself;
    why take me to your father?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:9 And Jonathan said, Do not have such a thought: for if I saw that my father was
    designing evil against you, would I not give you word of it?
    ---------------------Page 536---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:10 Then David said to Jonathan, Who will give me word if your father gives you a
    rough answer?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:11 And Jonathan said to David, Come, let us go out into the country. And the two of
    them went out together into the open country.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:12 And Jonathan said to David, May the Lord, the God of Israel, be witness; when I
    have had a chance of talking to my father, about this time tomorrow, if his feelings to David are
    good, will I not send and give you the news?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:13 May the Lord's punishment be on Jonathan, if it is my father's pleasure to do you
    evil and I do not give you word of it and send you away so that you may go in peace: and may the
    Lord be with you, as he has been with my father.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:14 And may you, while I am still living, O may you be kind to me, as the Lord is
    kind, and keep me from death!

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:15 And let not your mercy ever be cut off from my family, even when the Lord has
    sent destruction on all David's haters, cutting them off from the face of the earth.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:16 And if it comes about that the name of Jonathan is cut off from the family of
    David, the Lord will make David responsible.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:17 And Jonathan again took an oath to David, because of his love for him: for David
    was as dear to him as his very soul.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:18 Then Jonathan said to him, Tomorrow is the new moon: and it will be seen that
    you are not present, for there will be no one in your seat.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:19 And on the third day it will be specially noted, and you will go to the place where
    you took cover when the other business was in hand, waiting by the hill over there.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:20 And on the third day I will send arrows from my bow against its side as if at a
    mark.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:21 And I will send my boy to have a look for the arrow. And if I say to him, See, the
    arrow is on this side of you; take it up! then you may come; for there is peace for you and no evil,
    by the living Lord.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:22 But if I say to the boy, See, the arrow has gone past you: then go on your way, for
    the Lord has sent you away.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:23 As for what you and I were talking of, the Lord is between you and me for ever.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:24 So David went to a secret place in the country: and when the new moon came, the
    king took his place at the feast.
    ---------------------Page 537---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:25 And the king took his seat, as at other times, by the wall: and Jonathan was in
    front, and Abner was seated by Saul's side, but there was no one in David's seat.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:26 But Saul said nothing that day, for his thought was, Something has taken place
    making him unclean; it is clear that he is not clean.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:27 And on the day after the new moon, that is, the second day, there was still no one
    in David's seat: and Saul said to his son Jonathan, Why has the son of Jesse not come to the feast
    yesterday or today?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:28 And answering Saul, Jonathan said, He made a request to me that he might go to
    Beth-lehem,

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:29 Saying, Our family is making an offering in the town, and my brothers have given
    me orders to be there: so now, if I have grace in your eyes, let me go away and see my brothers.
    This is why he has not come to the king's table.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:30 Then Saul was moved to wrath against Jonathan, and he said to him, You son of
    an evil and uncontrolled woman, have I not seen how you have given your love to the son of Jesse,
    to your shame and the shame of your mother?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:31 For while the son of Jesse is living on the earth, your position is unsafe and your
    kingdom is in danger. So make him come here to me, for it is certainly right for him to be put to
    death.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:32 And Jonathan, answering his father Saul, said to him, Why is he to be put to
    death? What has he done?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:33 And Saul, pointing his spear at him, made an attempt to give him a wound: from
    which it was clear to Jonathan that his father's purpose was to put David to death.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:34 So Jonathan got up from the table, burning with wrath, and took no part in the
    feast the second day of the month, being full of grief for David because his father had put shame on
    him.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:35 Now in the morning, Jonathan went out into the fields at the time he had said to
    David, and he had a little boy with him.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:36 And he said to the boy, Go and get the arrow I let loose from my bow. And while
    the boy was running, he sent an arrow past him.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:37 And when the boy came to the place where the arrow was, Jonathan, crying out
    after the boy, said, Has it not gone past you?
    ---------------------Page 538---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:38 And Jonathan went on crying out after the boy, Be quick, do not keep waiting
    about, go quickly. And Jonathan's boy got the arrow and came back to his master.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:39 But the boy had no idea what was going on; only Jonathan and David had
    knowledge of it.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:40 And Jonathan gave his bow and arrows to the boy, and said to him, Take these and
    go back to the town.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:41 And when the boy had gone, David came from his secret place by the hill, and
    falling to the earth went down on his face three times: and they gave one another a kiss, weeping
    together, till David's grief was the greater.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 20:42 And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, for we two have taken an oath, in the
    name of the Lord, saying, The Lord will be between me and you, and between my seed and your
    seed for ever. Then David went away, and Jonathan went into the town.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 21

    1 </br></br>Samuel 21:1 Then David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was full of fear
    at meeting David, and said to him, Why are you by yourself, having no man with you?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 21:2 And David said to Ahimelech the priest, The king has given me orders and has said
    to me, Say nothing to anyone about the business on which I am sending you and the orders I have
    given you: and a certain place has been fixed to which the young men are to go.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 21:3 So now, if you have here five cakes of bread, give them into my hand, or whatever
    you have.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 21:4 And the priest, answering David, said, I have no common bread here but there is
    holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 21:5 And David in answer said to the priest, Certainly women have been kept from us;
    and as has been done before when I have gone out the arms of the young men were made holy,
    even though it was a common journey; how much more today will their arms be made holy.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 21:6 So the priest gave him the holy bread: there was no other, only the holy bread which
    had been taken from before the Lord, so that new bread might be put in its place on the day when it
    was taken away.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 21:7 Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, kept back before the
    Lord; his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the strongest of Saul's runners.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 21:8 And David said to Ahimelech, Have you no sword or spear with you here? for I
    have come without my sword and other arms, because the king's business had to be done quickly.
    ---------------------Page 539---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 21:9 And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you put to death in
    the valley of Elah, is here folded in a cloth at the back of the ephod: take that, if you will, for there
    is no other sword here. And David said, there is no other sword like that; give it to me.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 21:10 Then David got up and went in flight that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish,
    the king of Gath.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 21:11 And the servants of Achish said to him, Is not this David, the king of the land? did
    they not make songs about him in their dances, saying, Saul has put to death thousands, and David
    tens of thousands?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 21:12 And David took these words to heart, fearing Achish, the king of Gath.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 21:13 So changing his behaviour before them, he made it seem as if he was off his head,
    hammering on the doors of the town, and letting the water from his mouth go down his chin.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 21:14 Then Achish said to his servants, Look! the man is clearly off his head; why have
    you let him come before me?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 21:15 Are there not enough unbalanced men about me, that you have let this person
    come and do such tricks before me? is such a man to come into my house?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 22

    1 </br></br>Samuel 22:1 So David went away from there and took cover in a strong place at Adullam; and
    his brothers and all his father's people, hearing of it, went down to him there.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 22:2 And everyone who was in trouble, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone
    who was bitter in soul, came together to him, and he became captain over them: about four hundred
    men were joined to him.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 22:3 And from there David went to Mizpeh in the land of Moab: and he said to the king
    of Moab, Let my father and mother come and make their living-place with you till it is clear to me
    what God will do for me.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 22:4 And he took them to the king of Moab and they went on living with him while
    David was in his safe place.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 22:5 And the prophet Gad said to David, Do not go on living in this place but go into the
    land of Judah. Then David went away and came to the woodland of Hereth.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 22:6 And news was given to Saul that David had been seen, and the men who were with
    him: now Saul was in Gibeah, seated under the tree in the high place, with his spear in his hand,
    and all his servants were in their places before him.
    ---------------------Page 540---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 22:7 Then Saul said to his servants who were there about him, Give ear now, you
    Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give to every one of you fields and vine-gardens, will he make
    you all captains of hundreds and captains of thousands;

    1 </br></br>Samuel 22:8 That all of you have made designs against me, and not one of you gave me word
    when my son made an agreement with the son of Jesse, and not one of you has pity for me or has
    made my eyes open to the fact that my servant has been moved by my son against me, as at this
    day?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 22:9 Then Doeg, the Edomite, who was by the side of the servants of Saul, in answer
    said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 22:10 And he got directions from the Lord for him, and gave him food, and put in his
    hand the sword of Goliath the Philistine.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 22:11 Then the king sent for Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and for all the men
    of his father's family who were priests in Nob: and they all came to the king.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 22:12 And Saul said, Give ear now, O son of Ahitub. And answering he said, Here I am,
    my lord.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 22:13 And Saul said to him, Why have you made designs against me with the son of
    Jesse, giving him food and a sword and getting directions from the Lord for him, and helping him
    to take up arms against me, and to be on the watch to make a secret attack on me as he is doing
    now?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 22:14 Then Ahimelech answering said to the king, Who among all your servants is so
    true to you as David, who is the king's son-in-law, and is a captain of your armed men, and has a
    place of honour in your house?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 22:15 Is this the first time I have got directions from God for him? Far be the thought! let
    the king make no such statement against his servant or my father's family, for your servant has no
    knowledge, great or small, of this thing.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 22:16 And the king said, You will certainly be put to death, Ahimelech, you and all your
    father's family.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 22:17 Then the king said to the runners who were waiting near him, Put the priests of the
    Lord to death; because they are on David's side, and having knowledge of his flight, did not give
    me word of it. But the king's servants would not put out their hands to make an attack on the Lord's
    priests.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 22:18 Then the king said to Doeg, You are to put the priests to death. And Doeg the
    Edomite, turning on the priests and attacking them, put to death that day eighty-five men who took
    up the ephod.
    ---------------------Page 541---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 22:19 And Nob, the town of the priests, he put to the sword, all the men and women,
    children and babies at the breast, and oxen and asses and sheep.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 22:20 And Abiathar, one of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, got away and went
    in flight after David;

    1 </br></br>Samuel 22:21 And gave him the news of how Saul had put to death the Lord's priests.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 22:22 And David said to Abiathar, I was certain that day, when Doeg the Edomite was
    there, that he would take the news to Saul: I am responsible for the lives of all your father's family.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 22:23 Keep here with me and have no fear; for he who has designs on my life has
    designs on yours: but with me you will be safe.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23:1 And they sent word to David, saying, The Philistines are fighting against Keilah and
    taking the grain from the grain-floors.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23:2 So David, questioning the Lord, said, Am I to go and make an attack on these
    Philistines? And the Lord said to David, Go and make an attack on the Philistines so that Keilah
    may be kept from falling into their hands.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23:3 And David's men said to him, Even here in Judah we are full of fear: how much
    more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23:4 Then David put the question to the Lord again, and the Lord answering said, Up! go
    down to Keilah; for I will give the Philistines into your hands.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23:5 So David and his men went to Keilah, and had a fight with the Philistines, and took
    away their cattle, and put them to the sword with great destruction. So David was the saviour of the
    people of Keilah.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23:6 Now when Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech, went in flight to David, he came down
    to Keilah with the ephod in his hand.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23:7 And news was given to Saul that David had come to Keilah. And Saul said, Now
    God has given him into my hands; for by going into a walled town with locked doors, he has let
    himself be shut in.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23:8 And Saul sent for all the people to come to the fight, and go down to Keilah to
    make an attack on David and his men.
    ---------------------Page 542---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23:9 And it was clear to David that Saul had evil designs against him, and he said to
    Abiathar the priest, Come here with the ephod.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23:10 Then David said, O Lord, the God of Israel, news has been given to your servant
    that it is Saul's purpose to come to Keilah and send destruction on the town because of me.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23:11 And now, is it true, as they have said to me, that Saul is coming? O Lord, the God
    of Israel, give ear to your servant, and say if these things are so. And the Lord said, He is coming
    down.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23:12 Then David said, Will the men of Keilah give me and my men up to Saul? and the
    Lord said, They will give you up.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23:13 Then David and his men, about six hundred of them, went out of Keilah, and got
    away wherever they were able to go. And Saul, hearing that David had got away from Keilah, did
    not go there.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23:14 And David kept in the waste land, in safe places, waiting in the hill-country in the
    waste land of Ziph. And Saul was searching for him every day, but God did not give him up into
    his hands.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23:15 And David was full of fear, in the knowledge that Saul had come out to take his
    life; and David was in the waste land of Ziph, in Horesh.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23:16 And Saul's son Jonathan went to David in Horesh, and made his hands strong in
    God;

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23:17 And said to him, Have no fear, for Saul my father will not get you into his power;
    and you will be king of Israel, and I will be by your side, and my father Saul is certain of this.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23:18 And the two of them made an agreement before the Lord: and David went on
    living in Horesh, and Jonathan went back to his house.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23:19 Then the Ziphites came up to Gibeah to see Saul, and said, Is not David living
    secretly among us in the strong places in Horesh, in the hill of Hachilah to the south of the waste
    land?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23:20 So now, O king, have your soul's desire and come down, and we, for our part, will
    give him up into the king's hands.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23:21 And Saul said, The Lord's blessing will be yours, for you have had pity on me.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23:22 Go now, and take more steps, and see where he is living: for they say that he is
    expert in deceit.
    ---------------------Page 543---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23:23 So take care to get knowledge of all the secret places where he is taking cover, and
    be certain to come back to me, and I will go with you: and without doubt, if he is anywhere in the
    land, I will get him, among all the families of Judah.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23:24 And they went back and came to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in
    the waste land of Maon, in the dry land south of the waste land.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23:25 And Saul and his men went in search of him. And David had word of it, so he
    came down to the rock in the waste land of Maon. And Saul, hearing of this, went after David into
    the waste land of Maon.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23:26 And Saul and his men went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men
    went on the other: and David's purpose was to get away as quickly as possible, for fear of Saul; for
    Saul and his men were making a circle round David and his men in order to take them.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23:27 But a man came to Saul saying, Be quick and come; for the Philistines have made
    an attack on the land.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23:28 So turning back from going after David, Saul went against the Philistines: so that
    place was named Sela-hammah-lekoth.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 23:29 And from there, David went up and took cover in the safe place of En-gedi.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 24

    1 </br></br>Samuel 24:1 Now when Saul came back from fighting the Philistines, news was given him that
    David was in the waste land of En-gedi.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 24:2 Then Saul took three thousand of the best men out of all Israel, and went in search
    of David and his men on the rocks of the mountain goats.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 24:3 And on the way he came to a place where sheep were kept, where there was a
    hollow in the rock; and Saul went in for a private purpose. Now David and his men were in the
    deepest part of the hollow.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 24:4 And David's men said to him, Now is the time when the Lord says to you, I will
    give up your hater into your hands to do with him whatever seems good to you. Then David,
    getting up, took the skirt of Saul's robe in his hand, cutting off the end of it without his knowledge.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 24:5 And later, David was full of regret for cutting off Saul's skirt.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 24:6 And David said to his men, Before the Lord, never let it be said that my hand was
    lifted up against my lord, the man of the Lord's selection, for the Lord's holy oil has been put on
    him.
    ---------------------Page 544---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 24:7 So with these words David kept his servants back, and did not let them make an
    attack on Saul. And Saul got up and went on his way.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 24:8 And after that David came out of the hollow rock, and crying after Saul said, My
    lord the king. And when Saul gave a look back, David went down on his face and gave him honour.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 24:9 And David said to Saul, Why do you give any attention to those who say that it is
    my desire to do you wrong?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 24:10 Look! you have seen today how the Lord gave you up into my hands even now in
    the hollow of the rocks: and some would have had me put you to death, but I had pity on you: for I
    said, Never will my hand be lifted up against my lord, who has been marked with the holy oil.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 24:11 And see, my father, see the skirt of your robe in my hand: for the fact that I took
    off the skirt of your robe and did not put you to death is witness that I have no evil purpose, and I
    have done you no wrong, though you are waiting for my life to take it.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 24:12 May the Lord be judge between me and you, and may the Lord give me my rights
    against you, but my hand will never be lifted up against you.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 24:13 There is an old saying, From the evil-doer comes evil: but my hand will never be
    lifted up against you.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 24:14 After whom has the king of Israel come out? for whom are you searching? for a
    dead dog, an insect.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 24:15 So let the Lord be judge, and give a decision between me and you, and see and
    give support to my cause, and keep me from falling into your hands.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 24:16 Now when David had said these words to Saul, Saul said, Is this your voice,
    David, my son? And Saul was overcome with weeping.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 24:17 And he said to David, You are right and I am wrong: for you have given me back
    good, but I have given you evil.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 24:18 And you have made clear to me how good you have been to me today: because,
    when the Lord gave me up into your hands, you did not put me to death.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 24:19 If a man comes across his hater, will he let him get away safe? so may you be
    rewarded by the Lord for what you have done for me today.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 24:20 And now I am certain that you will be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be
    made strong under your authority.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 24:21 So give me your oath by the Lord, that you will not put an end to my seed after me
    or let my name be cut off from my father's family.
    ---------------------Page 545---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 24:22 And David gave Saul his oath. And Saul went back to his house; but David and his
    men went up to their safe place.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:1 And death came to </br></br>Samuel; and all Israel came together, weeping for him, and put
    his body in its resting-place in his house at Ramah. Then David went down to the waste land of
    Maon.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:2 Now there was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel; he was a great man
    and had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats: and he was cutting the wool of his sheep in
    Carmel.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:3 Now this man was named Nabal, and his wife's name was Abigail: she was a
    woman of good sense and pleasing looks: but the man was cruel and evil in his ways; he was of the
    family of Caleb.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:4 And David had word in the waste land that Nabal was cutting the wool of his sheep.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:5 And David sent ten young men, and said to them, Go up to Carmel and go to Nabal,
    and say kind words to him in my name;

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:6 And say this to my brother, May all be well for you: peace be to you and your house
    and all you have.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:7 I have had word that you have wool-cutters: now the keepers of your sheep have
    been with us, and we have done them no evil, and taken nothing of theirs while they were in
    Carmel.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:8 If your young men are questioned they will say the same thing. So now, let my
    young men have grace in your eyes, for we are come at a good time; please give anything you may
    have by you to your servants and to your son David.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:9 And when David's young men came, they said all this to Nabal, in David's name,
    and said nothing more.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:10 And Nabal gave them his answer and said, Who is David? who is the son of Jesse?
    there are a number of servants in these days running away from their masters.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:11 Am I to take my bread and my wine and the meat I have got ready for my wool-
    cutters and give it to men coming from I have no idea where?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:12 So David's young men, turning away, went back and gave him an account of
    everything he had said.
    ---------------------Page 546---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:13 And David said to his men, Put on your swords, every one of you. And every man
    put on his sword; and David did the same; and about four hundred men went up with David, and
    two hundred kept watch over their goods.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:14 But one of the young men said to Nabal's wife Abigail, David sent men from the
    waste land to say kind words to our master, and he gave them a rough answer.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:15 But these men have been very good to us; they did us no wrong and nothing of
    ours was touched while we were with them in the fields:

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:16 But day and night they were like a wall round us while we were with them,
    looking after the sheep.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:17 So now, give thought to what you are going to do; for evil is in store for our
    master and all his house: for he is such a good-for-nothing person that it is not possible to say
    anything to him.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:18 Then Abigail quickly took two hundred cakes of bread and two skins full of wine
    and five sheep ready for cooking and five measures of dry grain and a hundred parcels of dry
    grapes and two hundred cakes of figs, and put them on asses.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:19 And she said to her young men, Go on in front of me and I will come after you.
    But she said nothing to her husband Nabal.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:20 Now while she was going down under cover of the mountain on her ass, David
    and his men came down against her, and suddenly she came face to face with them.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:21 Now David had said, What was the use of my taking care of this man's goods in
    the waste land, so that there was no loss of anything which was his? he has only given me back evil
    for good.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:22 May God's punishment be on David, if when morning comes there is so much as
    one male of his people still living.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:23 And when Abigail saw David, she quickly got off her ass, falling down on her face
    before him.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:24 And falling at his feet she said, May the wrong be on me, my lord, on me: let your
    servant say a word to you, and give ear to the words of your servant.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:25 Let my lord give no attention to Nabal, that good-for-nothing: for as his name is,
    so is he, a man without sense: but I, your servant, did not see the young men whom my lord sent.
    ---------------------Page 547---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:26 So now, my lord, by the living God and by your living soul, seeing that the Lord
    has kept you from the crime of blood and from taking into your hands the punishment for your
    wrongs, may all your haters, and those who would do evil to my lord, be like Nabal.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:27 And let this offering, which your servant gives to my lord, be given to the young
    men who are with my lord.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:28 And may the sin of your servant have forgiveness: for the Lord will certainly make
    your family strong, because my lord is fighting in the Lord's war; and no evil will be seen in you all
    your days.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:29 And though a man has taken up arms against you, putting your life in danger, still
    the soul of my lord will be kept safe among the band of the living with the Lord your God; and the
    souls of those who are against you he will send violently away from him, like stones from a bag.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:30 And when the Lord has done for my lord all those good things which he has said
    he will do for you, and has made you a ruler over Israel;

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:31 Then you will have no cause for grief, and my lord's heart will not be troubled
    because you have taken life without cause and have yourself given punishment for your wrongs:
    and when the Lord has been good to you, then give a thought to your servant.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:32 And David said to Abigail, May the Lord, the God of Israel, be praised, who sent
    you to me today:

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:33 A blessing on your good sense and on you, who have kept me today from the
    crime of blood and from taking into my hands the punishment for my wrongs.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:34 For truly, by the living Lord, the God of Israel, who has kept me from doing you
    evil, if you had not been so quick in coming to me and meeting me, by dawn there would not have
    been in Nabal's house so much as one male living.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:35 Then David took from her hands her offering: and he said to her, Go back to your
    house in peace; see, I have given ear to your voice, and taken your offering with respect.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:36 And Abigail went back to Nabal; and he was feasting in his house like a king; and
    Nabal's heart was full of joy, for he had taken much wine; so she said nothing to him till dawn
    came.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:37 And in the morning, when the effect of the wine was gone, Nabal's wife gave him
    an account of all these things, and all the heart went out of him, and he became like stone.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:38 And about ten days after, the Lord sent disease on Nabal and death came to him.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:39 And David, hearing that Nabal was dead, said, May the Lord be praised, who has
    taken up my cause against Nabal for the shame which he put on me, and has kept back his servant
    ---------------------Page 548---------------------

    from evil, and has sent on Nabal's head the reward of his evil-doing. And David sent word to
    Abigail, desiring to take her as his wife.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:40 And when David's servants came to Carmel, to Abigail, they said to her, David has
    sent us to you to take you to him as his wife.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:41 And she got up, and going down on her face to the earth, said, See, I am ready to
    be a servant-girl, washing the feet of the servants of my lord.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:42 Then Abigail got up quickly and went on her ass, with five of her young women,
    after the men whom David had sent; and she became David's wife.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:43 And David had taken Ahinoam of Jezreel, to be his wife; these two were his
    wives.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 25:44 Now Saul had given his daughter Michal, David's wife, to Palti the son of Laish of
    Gallim.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 26

    1 </br></br>Samuel 26:1 And the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, and said, Is not David waiting secretly
    near us in the hill of Hachilah, before the waste land?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 26:2 Then Saul went down to the waste land of Ziph, taking with him three thousand of
    the best men of Israel, to make search for David in the waste land of Ziph.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 26:3 And Saul put up his tents on the hill of Hachilah, which is in front of the waste land
    on the road. But David was in the waste land, and he saw that Saul was coming after him.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 26:4 And so David sent out watchers, and got word from them that Saul was certainly
    coming.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 26:5 And David got up and came to the place where Saul's tents were: and David had a
    view of the place where Saul was sleeping with Abner, the son of Ner, the captain of his army: and
    Saul was sleeping inside the ring of carts, and the tents of the people were all round him.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 26:6 Then David said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai, the son of Zeruiah,
    brother of Joab, Who will go down with me to the tents of Saul? And Abishai said, I will go down
    with you.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 26:7 So David and Abishai came down to the army by night: and Saul was sleeping
    inside the ring of carts with his spear planted in the earth by his head: and Abner and the people
    were sleeping round him.
    ---------------------Page 549---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 26:8 Then Abishai said to David, God has given up your hater into your hands today;
    now let me give him one blow through to the earth with his spear, and there will be no need to give
    him a second.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 26:9 And David said to Abishai Do not put him to death; for who, without sin, may put
    out his hand against the man on whom the Lord has put the holy oil?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 26:10 And David said, By the living Lord, the Lord will send destruction on him; the
    natural day of his death will come, or he will go into the fight and come to his end.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 26:11 Never will my hand be stretched out against the man marked with the holy oil; but
    take the spear which is by his head and the vessel of water, and let us go.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 26:12 So David took the spear and the vessel of water from Saul's head; and they got
    away without any man seeing them, or being conscious of their coming, or awaking; for they were
    all sleeping because a deep sleep from the Lord had come on them.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 26:13 Then David went over to the other side, and took his place on the top of a
    mountain some distance away, with a great space between them;

    1 </br></br>Samuel 26:14 And crying out to the people and to Abner, the son of Ner, David said, Have you
    no answer to give, Abner? Then Abner said, Who is that crying out to the king?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 26:15 And David said to Abner, Are you not a man of war? is there any other like you in
    Israel? why then have you not kept watch over your lord the king? for one of the people came in to
    put the king your lord to death.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 26:16 What you have done is not good. By the living Lord, death is the right fate for you,
    because you have not kept watch over your lord, the man on whom the Lord has put the holy oil.
    Now see, where is the king's spear, and the vessel of water which was by his head?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 26:17 And Saul, conscious that the voice was David's, said, Is that your voice, David, my
    son? And David said, It is my voice, O my lord king.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 26:18 And he said, Why does my lord go armed against his servant? what have I done?
    or what evil is there in me?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 26:19 Let my lord the king give ear now to the words of his servant. If it is the Lord who
    is moving you against me, let him take an offering: but if it is the children of men, may they be
    cursed before the Lord, for driving me out today and keeping me from my place in the heritage of
    the Lord, saying, Go, be the servant of other gods.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 26:20 Then do not let my blood be drained out on the earth away from the face of the
    Lord: for the king of Israel has come out to take my life, like one going after birds in the mountains.
    ---------------------Page 550---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 26:21 Then Saul said, I have done wrong: come back to me, David my son: I will do you
    no more wrong, because my life was dear to you today truly, I have been foolish and my error is
    very great.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 26:22 Then David said, Here is the king's spear! let one of the young men come over and
    get it.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 26:23 And the Lord will give to every man the reward of his righteousness and his faith:
    because the Lord gave you into my hands today, and I would not put out my hand against the man
    who has been marked with the holy oil.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 26:24 And so, as your life was dear to me today, may my life be dear to the Lord, and
    may he make me free from all my troubles.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 26:25 Then Saul said to David, May a blessing be on you, David, my son; you will do
    great things and without doubt you will overcome. Then David went on his way, and Saul went
    back to his place.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 27

    1 </br></br>Samuel 27:1 And David said to himself, Some day death will come to me by the hand of Saul:
    the only thing for me to do is to get away into the land of the Philistines; then Saul will give up
    hope of taking me in any part of the land of Israel: and so I may be able to get away from him.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 27:2 So David and the six hundred men who were with him went over to Achish, the son
    of Maoch, king of Gath.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 27:3 And David and his men were living with Achish at Gath; every man had his family
    with him, and David had his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel, and Abigail of Carmel, who had been
    the wife of Nabal.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 27:4 And Saul, hearing that David had gone to Gath, went after him no longer.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 27:5 Then David said to Achish, If now I have grace in your eyes, let me have a place in
    one of the smaller towns of your land, to be my living-place; for it is not right for your servant to be
    living with you in the king's town.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 27:6 So Achish straight away gave him Ziklag: and for that reason Ziklag has been the
    property of the kings of Judah to this day.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 27:7 And David was living in the land of the Philistines for the space of a year and four
    months.
    ---------------------Page 551---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 27:8 And David and his men went up and made attacks on the Geshurites and the
    Girzites and the Amalekites; for these were the people who were living in the land from Telam on
    the way to Shur, as far as Egypt.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 27:9 And David again and again made attacks on the land till not a man or a woman was
    still living; and he took away the sheep and the oxen and the asses and the camels and the clothing;
    and he came back to Achish.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 27:10 And every time Achish said, Where have you been fighting today? David said,
    Against the South of Judah and the South of the Jerahmeelites and the South of the Kenites.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 27:11 Not one living man or woman did David ever take back with him to Gath, fearing
    that they might give an account of what had taken place, and say, This is what David did, and so
    has he been doing all the time while he has been living in the land of the Philistines.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 27:12 And Achish had belief in what David said, saying, He has made himself hated by
    all his people Israel, and so he will be my servant for ever.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 28

    1 </br></br>Samuel 28:1 Now in those days the Philistines got their forces together to make war on Israel.
    And Achish said to David, Certainly you and your men are to go out with me to the fight.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 28:2 And David said to Achish, You will see now what your servant will do. And Achish
    said to David, Then I will make you keeper of my head for ever.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 28:3 Now </br></br>Samuel was dead, and all Israel, after weeping for him, had put his body in its
    last resting-place in Ramah, his town. And Saul had put away from the land all those who had
    control of spirits and who made use of secret arts.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 28:4 And the Philistines came together and put their forces in position in Shunem; and
    Saul got all Israel together and they took up their positions in Gilboa.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 28:5 And when Saul saw the Philistine army he was troubled, and his heart was moved
    with fear.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 28:6 And when Saul went for directions to the Lord, the Lord gave him no answer, by a
    dream or by the Urim or by the prophets.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 28:7 Then Saul said to his servants, Get me a woman who has control of a spirit so that I
    may go to her and get directions. And his servants said to him, There is such a woman at En-dor.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 28:8 So Saul, putting on other clothing, so that he might not be seen to be the king, took
    two men with him and went to the woman by night; and he said, Now, with the help of the spirit
    which you have, make the person whose name I will give you come up.
    ---------------------Page 552---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 28:9 And the woman said to him, But you have knowledge of what Saul has done, how
    he has put away out of the land those who have control of spirits and the users of secret arts: why
    would you, by a trick, put me in danger of death?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 28:10 And Saul made an oath to her by the Lord, saying, By the living Lord, no
    punishment will come to you for this.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 28:11 Then the woman said, Who am I to let you see? And he said, Make </br></br>Samuel come
    up for me.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 28:12 And the woman saw that it was Saul, and she gave a loud cry, and said to Saul,
    Why have you made use of deceit? for you are Saul.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 28:13 And the king said to her, Have no fear: what do you see? And the woman said to
    Saul, I see a god coming up out of the earth.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 28:14 And he said to her, What is his form? And she said, It is an old man coming up
    covered with a robe. And Saul saw that it was </br></br>Samuel, and with his face bent down to the earth he
    gave him honour.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 28:15 And </br></br>Samuel said to Saul, Why have you made me come up, troubling my rest?
    And Saul in answer said, I am in great danger; for the Philistines are making war on me, and God
    has gone away from me and will no longer give me any answer, by the prophets or by dreams: so I
    have sent for you to make clear to me what I am to do.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 28:16 And </br></br>Samuel said, Why do you put your questions to me, seeing that God has gone
    away from you and is on the side of him who is against you?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 28:17 And the Lord himself has done what I said: the Lord has taken the kingdom out of
    your hand and given it to your neighbour David;

    1 </br></br>Samuel 28:18 Because you did not do what the Lord said, and did not give effect to his burning
    wrath against Amalek. So the Lord has done this thing to you today.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 28:19 And more than this, the Lord will give Israel up with you into the hands of the
    Philistines: and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me: and the Lord will give up the army of
    Israel into the hands of the Philistines.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 28:20 Then Saul went down flat on the earth, and was full of fear because of </br></br>Samuel's
    words: and there was no strength in him, for he had taken no food all that day or all that night.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 28:21 And the woman came to Saul and saw that he was in great trouble, and said to
    him, See now, your servant has given ear to your words, and I have put my life in danger by doing
    what you said.
    ---------------------Page 553---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 28:22 So now, give ear to the voice of your servant, and let me give you a little bread;
    and take some food to give you strength when you go on your way.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 28:23 But he would not, saying, I have no desire for food. But his servants, together with
    the woman, made him take food, and he gave way to them. So he got up from the earth, and took
    his seat on the bed.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 28:24 And the woman had in the house a young cow, made fat for food; and she put it to
    death straight away; and she took meal and got it mixed and made unleavened bread;

    1 </br></br>Samuel 28:25 And she put it before Saul and his servants, and they had a meal. Then they got up
    and went away the same night.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 29

    1 </br></br>Samuel 29:1 Now the Philistines got all their army together at Aphek: and the Israelites put their
    forces in position by the fountain in Jezreel.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 29:2 And the lords of the Philistines went on with their hundreds and their thousands,
    and David and his men came after with Achish.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 29:3 Then the rulers of the Philistines said, What are these Hebrews doing here? And
    Achish said to the rulers of the Philistines, Is this not David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel,
    who has been with me for a year or two, and I have never seen any wrong in him from the time
    when he came to me till now?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 29:4 But the rulers of the Philistines were angry with him, and said to him, Make the
    man go back to the place you have given him; do not let him go down with us to the fight, or he
    may be turned against us and be false to us: for how will this man make peace with his lord? will it
    not be with the heads of these men?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 29:5 Is this not David, who was named in their songs, when in the dance they said to one
    another, Saul has put to death thousands, and David tens of thousands?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 29:6 Then Achish sent for David and said to him, By the living Lord, you are upright,
    and everything you have done with me in the army has been pleasing to me: I have seen no evil in
    you from the day when you came to me till now: but still, the lords are not pleased with you.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 29:7 So now go back, and go in peace, so that you do not make the lords of the
    Philistines angry.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 29:8 And David said to Achish, But what have I done? what have you seen in your
    servant while I have been with you till this day, that I may not go and take up arms against those
    who are now making war on my lord the king?
    ---------------------Page 554---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 29:9 And Achish in answer said, It is true that in my eyes you are good, like an angel of
    God: but still, the rulers of the Philistines have said, He is not to go up with us to the fight.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 29:10 So get up early in the morning, with the servants of your lord who are with you,
    and go to the place I have given you, and have no evil design in your heart, for you are good in my
    eyes; but when there is light enough in the morning, go away.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 29:11 So David and his men got up early in the morning to go back to the land of the
    Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:1 Now when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, the Amalekites had
    made an attack on the South and on Ziklag, and had overcome Ziklag and put it on fire;

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:2 And had made the women and all who were there, small and great, prisoners: they
    had not put any of them to death, but had taken them all away.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:3 And when David and his men came to the town, they saw that it had been burned
    down, and their wives and their sons and daughters had been made prisoners.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:4 Then David and the people who were with him gave themselves up to weeping till
    they were able to go on weeping no longer.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:5 And David's two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the wife of Nabal of
    Carmel, had been made prisoners.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:6 And David was greatly troubled; for the people were talking of stoning him,
    because their hearts were bitter, every man sorrowing for his sons and his daughters: but David
    made himself strong in the Lord his God.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:7 And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, Come here to me with
    the ephod. And Abiathar took the ephod to David.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:8 Then David, questioning the Lord, said, Am I to go after this band? will I be able to
    overtake them? And in answer he said, Go after them, for you will certainly overtake them, and get
    back everything.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:9 So David went, and his six hundred men went with him, and they came to the
    stream Besor.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:10 And David, with four hundred men, went on: but two hundred of them were
    overcome with weariness, and not able to go across the stream.
    ---------------------Page 555---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:11 And in the fields they saw an Egyptian whom they took to David, and they gave
    him bread, and he had a meal, and they gave him water for drink;

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:12 And they gave him part of a cake of figs and some dry grapes; and after the food,
    his spirit came back to him, for he had had no food or drink for three days and nights.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:13 And David said to him, Whose man are you and where do you come from? And he
    said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master went on without me
    because three days back I became ill.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:14 We made an attack on the south part of the country of the Cherethites, and on the
    land which is Judah's, and on the south of Caleb; and we put Ziklag on fire.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:15 And David said to him, Will you take me down to this band? And he said, If you
    give me your oath that you will not put me to death or give me up to my master, I will take you to
    them.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:16 And when he had taken him down, they saw them all, seated about on all sides,
    feasting and drinking among all the mass of goods which they had taken from the land of the
    Philistines and the land of Judah.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:17 And David went on fighting them from evening till the evening of the day after;
    and not one of them got away but only four hundred young men who went in flight on camels.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:18 And David got back everything the Amalekites had taken; and he got back his two
    wives.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:19 There was no loss of anything, small or great, sons or daughters or goods or
    anything which they had taken away: David got it all back.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:20 And they took all the flocks and herds, and driving them in front of him, said,
    These are David's.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:21 And David came to the two hundred men, who because of weariness had not gone
    with him, but were waiting at the stream Besor: and they went out, meeting David and the people
    who were with him; and when they came near them, they said, How are you?

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:22 Then the bad and good-for-nothing men among those who went with David said,
    Because they did not go with us, we will give them nothing of the goods which we have got back,
    but only to every man his wife and children, so that he may take them and go.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:23 Then David said, You are not to do this, my brothers, after what the Lord has
    given us, who has kept us safe and given up the band which came against us into our hands.
    ---------------------Page 556---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:24 Who is going to give any attention to you in this question? for an equal part will be
    given to him who went to the fight and to him who was waiting by the goods: they are all to have
    the same.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:25 And so he made it a rule and an order for Israel from that day till now.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:26 And when David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the goods to the responsible men
    of Judah, and to his friends, saying, Here is an offering for you from the goods of those who were
    fighting against the Lord;

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:27 He sent to those who were in Beth-el, and in Ramah of the South, and in Jattir;

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:28 And to those in Arara and Eshtemoa

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:29 and Carmel and in the towns of the Jerahmeelites, and in the towns of the Kenites;

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:30 And to those who were in Hormah and in Bor-ashan and in Athach;

    1 </br></br>Samuel 30:31 And in Hebron, and to all the places where David and his men had been living.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 31

    1 </br></br>Samuel 31:1 Now the Philistines were fighting against Israel: and the men of Israel went in flight
    before the Philistines, falling down wounded in Mount Gilboa.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 31:2 And the Philistines overtook Saul and his sons; and they put to death Jonathan and
    Abinadab and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 31:3 And the fight was going badly for Saul, and the archers came across him, and he
    was wounded by the archers.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 31:4 Then Saul said to the servant who had the care of his arms, Take out your sword
    and put it through me, before these men without circumcision come and make sport of me. But his
    servant, full of fear, would not do so. Then Saul took out his sword, and falling on it, put an end to
    himself.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 31:5 And when his servant saw that Saul was dead, he did the same, and was united with
    him in death.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 31:6 So death overtook Saul and his three sons and his servant on the same day.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 31:7 And when the men of Israel across the valley and on the other side of Jordan saw
    that the army of Israel was in flight and that Saul and his sons were dead, they came out of their
    towns and went in flight; and the Philistines came and took them for themselves.
    ---------------------Page 557---------------------

    1 </br></br>Samuel 31:8 Now on the day after, when the Philistines came to take their goods from the dead,
    they saw Saul and his three sons dead on the earth in Mount Gilboa.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 31:9 And cutting off his head and taking away his war-dress, they sent word into the land
    of the Philistines round about, to take the news to their gods and to the people.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 31:10 His war-dress they put in the house of Astarte; and his body was fixed on the wall
    of Beth-shan.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 31:11 And when the people of Jabesh-gilead had news of what the Philistines had done
    to Saul,

    1 </br></br>Samuel 31:12 All the fighting men got up and, travelling all night, took Saul's body and the
    bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan; and they came to Jabesh and had them burned there.

    1 </br></br>Samuel 31:13 And their bones they put in the earth under a tree in Jabesh; and for seven days
    they took no food.

    2 </br></br>Samuel

    2 </br></br>Samuel 1

    2 </br></br>Samuel 1:1 Now after the death of Saul, when David, having come back from the destruction of
    the Amalekites, had been in Ziklag for two days;

    2 </br></br>Samuel 1:2 On the third day a man came from Saul's tents, with his clothing out of order and
    earth on his head: and when he came to David, he went down on the earth and gave him honour.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 1:3 And David said to him, Where have you come from? And he said, I have come in
    flight from the tents of Israel.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 1:4 And David said to him, How did things go? Give me the news. And in answer he
    said, The people have gone in flight from the fight, and a great number of them are dead; and Saul
    and his son Jonathan are dead.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 1:5 And David said to the young man who gave him the news, Why are you certain that
    Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 1:6 And the young man said, I came by chance to Mount Gilboa, and I saw Saul
    supporting himself on his spear; and the war-carriages and horsemen overtook him.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 1:7 And looking back, he saw me and gave a cry to me. And answering him I said, Here
    am I.
    ---------------------Page 558---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 1:8 And he said to me, Who are you? And I said, I am an Amalekite.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 1:9 Then he said to me, Come here to my side, and put me to death, for the pain of death
    has me in its grip but my life is still strong in me.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 1:10 So I put my foot on him and gave him his death-blow, because I was certain that he
    would not go on living after his fall: and I took the crown from his head and the band from his arm,
    and I have them here for my lord.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 1:11 Then David gave way to bitter grief, and so did all the men who were with him:

    2 </br></br>Samuel 1:12 And till evening they gave themselves to sorrow and weeping, and took no food,
    weeping for Saul and for Jonathan, his son, and for the people of the Lord and for the men of Israel;
    because they had come to their end by the sword.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 1:13 And David said to the young man who had given him the news, Where do you
    come from? And he said, I am the son of a man from a strange land; I am an Amalekite.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 1:14 And David said to him, Had you no fear of stretching out your hand to put to death
    the one marked with the holy oil?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 1:15 And David sent for one of his young men and said, Go near and put an end to him.
    And he put him to death.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 1:16 And David said to him, May your blood be on your head; for your mouth has given
    witness against you, saying, I have put to death the man marked with the holy oil.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 1:17 Then David made this song of grief for Saul and Jonathan, his son:

    2 </br></br>Samuel 1:18 (It is recorded in the book of Jashar for teaching to the sons of Judah) and he said:

    2 </br></br>Samuel 1:19 The glory, O Israel, is dead on your high places! How have the great ones been
    made low!

    2 </br></br>Samuel 1:20 Give no news of it in Gath, let it not be said in the streets of Ashkelon; or the
    daughters of the Philistines will be glad, the daughters of men without circumcision will be uplifted
    in joy.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 1:21 O mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew or rain on you, you fields of death: for
    there the arms of the strong have been shamed, the arms of Saul, as if he had not been marked with
    the holy oil.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 1:22 From the blood of the dead, from the fat of the strong, the bow of Jonathan was not
    turned back, the sword of Saul did not come back unused.
    ---------------------Page 559---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 1:23 Saul and Jonathan were loved and pleasing; in their lives and in their death they
    were not parted; they went more quickly than eagles, they were stronger than lions.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 1:24 O daughters of Israel, have sorrow for Saul, by whom you were delicately clothed
    in robes of red, with ornaments of gold on your dresses.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 1:25 How have the great ones been made low in the fight! Jonathan is dead on your high
    places.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 1:26 I am full of grief for you, my brother Jonathan: very dear have you been to me: your
    love for me was a wonder, greater than the love of women.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 1:27 How have the great ones been made low, and the arms of war broken!

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:1 Now after this, David, questioning the Lord, said, Am I to go up into any of the
    towns of Judah? And the Lord said to him, Go up. And David said, Where am I to go? And he said,
    To Hebron.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:2 So David went there, taking with him his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel, and
    Abigail, the wife of Nabal of Carmel.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:3 And David took all his men with him, every man with his family: and they were
    living in the towns round Hebron.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:4 And the men of Judah came there, and with the holy oil made David king over the
    people of Judah. And word came to David that it was the men of Jabesh-gilead who put Saul's body
    in its last resting-place.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:5 And David sent to the men of Jabesh-gilead and said to them, May the Lord give you
    his blessing, because you have done this kind act to Saul your lord, and have put his body to rest!

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:6 May the Lord be good and true to you: and I myself will see that your kind act is
    rewarded, because you have done this thing.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:7 Then let your hands be strong, and have no fear: though Saul your lord is dead, the
    people of Judah have made me their king.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:8 Now Abner, the son of Ner, captain of Saul's army, had taken Saul's son Ish-bosheth
    over to Mahanaim,

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:9 And made him king over Gilead and the Asherites and over Jezreel and Ephraim and
    Benjamin, that is, over all Israel.
    ---------------------Page 560---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:10 (Saul's son Ish-bosheth was forty years old when he became king over Israel, and he
    was ruler for two years.) But Judah was on the side of David.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:11 And the time when David was king in Hebron over the people of Judah was seven
    years and six months.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:12 And Abner, the son of Ner, with the servants of Saul's son Ish-bosheth, went out
    from Mahanaim to Gibeon.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:13 And Joab, the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out and came face to
    face with them by the pool of Gibeon; and they took up their position, facing one another on
    opposite sides of the pool.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:14 And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men give a test of their strength before us.
    And Joab said, Let them do so.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:15 So they got up and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth and
    twelve of the servants of David.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:16 And every one got the other by the head, driving his sword into the other's side, so
    they all went down together: and that place was named the Field of Sides, and it is in Gibeon.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:17 And there was hard fighting that day; and Abner and the men of Israel gave way
    before the servants of David.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:18 There were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab and Abishai and Asahel: and Asahel
    was as quick-footed as a roe of the fields.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:19 Asahel went running after Abner, not turning to the right or to the left.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:20 Then Abner, looking back, said, Is it you, Asahel? And he said, It is I.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:21 And Abner said, Then go to the right or to the left and put your hands on one of the
    fighting-men and take his arms. But Asahel would not be turned away from going after Abner.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:22 Then again Abner said to Asahel, Go to one side, do not keep on coming after me:
    why will you make me put an end to you? for then I will be shamed before your brother Joab.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:23 But still he did not go to one side: so Abner gave him a back blow in the stomach
    with his spear, so that the spear came out at his back; and he went down on the earth, wounded to
    death: and all those who came to the place where Asahel went down dead, came to a stop.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:24 But Joab and Abishai went after Abner: and the sun went down when they came to
    the hill of Ammah, which is to the east of the road through the waste land of Geba.
    ---------------------Page 561---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:25 And the men of Benjamin came together after Abner in one band, and took their
    places on the top of a hill.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:26 Then crying out to Joab, Abner said, Are fighting and destruction to go on for ever?
    do you not see that the end will only be bitter? how long will it be before you send the people back
    and make them give up attacking their countrymen?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:27 And Joab said, By the living God, if you had not given the word, the people would
    have gone on attacking their countrymen till the morning.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:28 So Joab had a horn sounded, and all the people came to a stop, and gave up going
    after Israel and fighting them.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:29 And all that night Abner and his men went through the Arabah; they went over
    Jordan and through all Bithron and came to Mahanaim.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:30 And Joab came back from fighting Abner: and when he had got all his men
    together, it was seen that nineteen of David's men, in addition to Asahel, were not with them.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:31 But David's men had put to death three hundred and sixty of the men of Benjamin
    and of Abner's men

    2 </br></br>Samuel 2:32 And they took Asahel's body and put it in the last resting-place of his father in Beth-
    lehem. And Joab and his men, travelling all night, came to Hebron at dawn.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:1 Now there was a long war between Saul's people and David's people; and David
    became stronger and stronger, but those on Saul's side became more and more feeble.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:2 While David was in Hebron he became the father of sons: the oldest was Amnon, son
    of Ahinoam of Jezreel;

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:3 And the second, Chileab, whose mother was Abigail, the wife of Nabal the
    Carmelite; and the third, Absalom, son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur;

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:4 And the fourth, Adonijah, the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah, the son of
    Abital;

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:5 And the sixth, Ithream, whose mother was David's wife Eglah. These were the sons
    of David, whose birth took place in Hebron.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:6 Now while there was war between Saul's people and David's people, Abner was
    making himself strong among the supporters of Saul.
    ---------------------Page 562---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:7 Now Saul had among his wives a woman named Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and
    Ish-bosheth said to Abner, Why have you taken my father's wife?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:8 And Abner was very angry at the words of Ish-bosheth, and he said, Am I a dog's
    head of Judah? I am this day doing all in my power for the cause of your father Saul and for his
    brothers and his friends, and have not given you up into the hands of David, and now you say I
    have done wrong with a woman.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:9 May God's punishment be on Abner, if I do not for David as the Lord in his oath has
    said,

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:10 And if I do not take away the kingdom from the family of Saul and make David
    ruler over Israel and Judah from Dan as far as Beer-sheba!

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:11 And so great was Ish-bosheth's fear of Abner that he was not able to say a word in
    answer.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:12 And Abner sent men to David at Hebron, saying, Make an agreement with me, and
    I will give you my support in getting all Israel on your side.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:13 And he said, It is well; I will make an agreement with you, but on one condition,
    which is, that when you come before me, Saul's daughter Michal is to come with you; till she
    comes you will not see my face.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:14 And David sent men to Saul's son Ish-bosheth, saying, Give me back Michal, my
    wife, whom I made mine for the price of the private parts of a hundred Philistines.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:15 So Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her husband Paltiel, the son of Laish.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:16 And her husband went with her as far as Bahurim, weeping while he went. Then
    Abner said to him, Go back. And he went back.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:17 Then Abner had a talk with the chief men of Israel, saying, In the past it was your
    desire to make David your king: so now, do it:

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:18 For the Lord has said of David, By the hand of my servant David I will make my
    people Israel safe from the Philistines, and from all who are against them.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:19 And Abner said the same things to Benjamin: and he went to David in Hebron to
    make clear to him what seemed good to Israel and to all the people of Benjamin.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:20 So Abner, with twenty men, came to Hebron, to David. And David made a feast for
    Abner and the men who were with him.
    ---------------------Page 563---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:21 And Abner said to David, Now I will go, and make all Israel come to my lord the
    king, so that they may make an agreement with you, and your kingdom may be as wide as your
    heart's desire. Then David sent Abner away and he went in peace.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:22 Now the servants of David and Joab had been out attacking a band of armed men,
    and they came back with a great store of goods taken in the fight: but Abner was no longer in
    Hebron with David, for he had sent him away and he had gone in peace.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:23 When Joab and his men came, news was given them that Abner, the son of Ner, had
    come to the king, who had let him go away again in peace.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:24 Then Joab came to the king, and said, What have you done? when Abner came to
    you why did you send him away and let him go?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:25 Is it not clear to you that Abner, the son of Ner, came with deceit to get knowledge
    of your going out and your coming in and of all you are doing?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:26 And when Joab had come out from David, he sent men after Abner, and they
    overtook him at the water-spring of Sirah, and made him come back with them: but David had no
    knowledge of it.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:27 And when Abner was back in Hebron, Joab took him on one side by the doorway of
    the town to have a word with him quietly, and there he gave him a wound in the stomach, causing
    his death in payment for the death of his brother Asahel.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:28 And when David had word of it he said, May I and my kingdom be clear for ever in
    the eyes of the Lord from the blood of Abner, the son of Ner:

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:29 May it come on the head of Joab and all his father's family: among the men of
    Joab's family may there ever be some who are diseased or lepers, or who do the work of women, or
    are put to the sword, or are wasted from need of food!

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:30 So Joab and Abishai his brother put Abner to death, because he had put to death
    their brother Asahel in the fight at Gibeon.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:31 And David said to Joab and all the people who were with him, Go in grief and put
    haircloth about you, in sorrow for Abner. And King David went after the dead body.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:32 And they put Abner's body to rest in Hebron; and the king and all the people were
    weeping loudly by the resting-place of Abner's body.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:33 And the king made a song of grief for Abner and said, Was the death of Abner to be
    like the death of a foolish man?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:34 Your hands were free, your feet were not chained: like the downfall of a man before
    evil men, so was your fall. And the weeping of the people over him went on again.
    ---------------------Page 564---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:35 And the people came to make David take food, while it was still day, but David
    with an oath said, May God's punishment be on me if I take a taste of bread or any other thing till
    the sun has gone down!

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:36 And all the people took note of it and were pleased: like everything the king did, it
    was pleasing to the people.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:37 So it was clear to Israel and to all the people on that day that the king was not
    responsible for the death of Abner, the son of Ner.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:38 And the king said to his servants, Do you not see that a chief and a great man has
    come to his end today in Israel?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 3:39 While I, though I am crowned king, have little strength, and these men, the sons of
    Zeruiah, are out of my control: may the Lord give to the evil-doer the reward of his evil-doing!

    2 </br></br>Samuel 4

    2 </br></br>Samuel 4:1 And when Saul's son Ish-bosheth had news that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands
    became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 4:2 And Saul's son had two men, captains of bands, one named Baanah and the other
    Rechab, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the tribe of Benjamin; (for Beeroth was at one time
    taken to be part of Benjamin:

    2 </br></br>Samuel 4:3 But the people of Beeroth had gone in flight to Gittaim, where they have been living
    to this day.)

    2 </br></br>Samuel 4:4 Now Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son whose feet were damaged. He was five years
    old when news of the death of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel, and the woman who took care
    of him took him up and went in flight: and while she was getting him away as quickly as she was
    able, he had a fall and his feet were damaged. His name was Mephibosheth.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 4:5 And Rechab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, went out and came to
    the house of Ish-bosheth in the heat of the day, when he was resting in the middle of the day. Now
    the woman who kept the door was cleaning grain, and sleep overcame her.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 4:6 And Rechab and his brother Baanah got in without being seen.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 4:7 And when they came into the house, Ish-bosheth was stretched on his bed in his
    bedroom; and they made an attack on him and put him to death, and, cutting off his head, they took
    it with them and went by the road through the Arabah all night.
    ---------------------Page 565---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 4:8 And they took the head of Ish-bosheth to David in Hebron, and said to the king, Here
    is the head of Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul your hater, who would have taken your life; the Lord has
    taken payment for the wrongs of my lord the king from Saul and his seed today.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 4:9 And David made answer to Rechab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the
    Beerothite, and said to them, By the living Lord, who has kept me safe from all my trouble,

    2 </br></br>Samuel 4:10 When one came to me with the news of Saul's death, in the belief that it would be
    good news, I took him and put him to death in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his
    news:

    2 </br></br>Samuel 4:11 How much more, when evil men have put an upright person to death, in his house,
    sleeping on his bed, will I take payment from you for his blood, and have you cut off from the
    earth?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 4:12 And David gave orders to his young men and they put them to death, cutting off
    their hands and their feet and hanging them up by the side of the pool in Hebron. But they took the
    head of Ish-bosheth and put it in its last resting-place with Abner's body in Hebron.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 5

    2 </br></br>Samuel 5:1 Then all the tribes of Israel came to David in Hebron and said, Truly, we are your
    bone and your flesh.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 5:2 In the past when Saul was king over us, it was you who went at the head of Israel
    when they went out or came in: and the Lord said to you, You are to be the keeper of my people
    Israel and their ruler.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 5:3 So all the responsible men of Israel came to the king at Hebron; and King David
    made an agreement with them in Hebron before the Lord: and they put the holy oil on David and
    made him king over Israel.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 5:4 David was thirty years old when he became king, and he was king for forty years,

    2 </br></br>Samuel 5:5 Ruling over Judah in Hebron for seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem, over
    all Israel and Judah, for thirty-three years.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 5:6 And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the people of the
    land: and they said to David, You will not come in here, but the blind and the feeble-footed will
    keep you out; for they said, David will not be able to come in here.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 5:7 But David took the strong place of Zion, which is the town of David.
    ---------------------Page 566---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 5:8 And that day David said, Whoever makes an attack on the Jebusites, let him go up by
    the water-pipe, and put to death all the blind and feeble-footed who are hated by David. And this is
    why they say, The blind and feeble-footed may not come into the house.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 5:9 So David took the strong tower for his living-place, naming it the town of David.
    And David took in hand the building of the town all round, starting from the Millo.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 5:10 And David became greater and greater; for the Lord, the God of armies, was with
    him.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 5:11 And Hiram, king of Tyre, sent men to David, with cedar-trees and woodworkers
    and stoneworkers: and they made David a house.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 5:12 And David saw that the Lord had made his position safe as king over Israel, and
    that he had made his kingdom great because of his people Israel.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 5:13 And David took more women and wives in Jerusalem, after he had come from
    Hebron: and he had more sons and daughters.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 5:14 These are the names of those whose birth took place in Jerusalem: Shammua and
    Shobab and Nathan and Solomon

    2 </br></br>Samuel 5:15 And Ibhar and Elishua and Nepheg and Japhia

    2 </br></br>Samuel 5:16 And Elishama and Eliada and Eliphelet.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 5:17 And when the Philistines had news that David had been made king over Israel, they
    all went up in search of David; and David, hearing of it, went down to the strong place.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 5:18 And when the Philistines came, they went in every direction in the valley of
    Rephaim.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 5:19 And David, desiring directions from the Lord, said, Am I to go up against the
    Philistines? will you give them up into my hands? And the Lord said, Go up, for I will certainly
    give up the Philistines into your hands.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 5:20 And David went to Baal-perazim, and overcame them there; and he said, The Lord
    has let the forces fighting against me be broken before me as a wall is broken by rushing waters. So
    that place was named Baal-perazim.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 5:21 And the Philistines, when they went in flight, did not take their images with them,
    and David and his men took them away.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 5:22 And the Philistines came up again, and went in every direction in the valley of
    Rephaim.
    ---------------------Page 567---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 5:23 And when David went for directions to the Lord, he said, You are not to go up
    against them in front; but make a circle round them from the back and come on them opposite the
    spice-trees.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 5:24 Then at the sound of footsteps in the tops of the trees, go forward quickly, for the
    Lord has gone out before you to overcome the army of the Philistines.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 5:25 And David did as the Lord had said; and he overcame the Philistines, attacking
    them from Gibeon to near Gezer.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 6

    2 </br></br>Samuel 6:1 And David got together all the fighting-men of Israel to the number of thirty
    thousand;

    2 </br></br>Samuel 6:2 And David, and all the people who were with him, went to Baal of Judah to get the
    ark of God, over which the holy name is named, the name of the Lord of armies, whose place is
    between the winged ones.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 6:3 And they put the ark of God on a new cart and took it out of the house of Abinadab
    which was on the hill: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were the drivers of the cart.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 6:4 And Uzzah went by the side of the ark, while Ahio went before it.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 6:5 And David and all the men of Israel made melody before the Lord with all their
    power, with songs and with corded instruments and instruments of brass.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 6:6 And when they came to Nacon's grain-floor, Uzzah put his hand on the ark of God to
    keep it safe in its place, for the oxen were out of control.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 6:7 And the wrath of the Lord, burning against Uzzah, sent destruction on him because
    he had put his hand on the ark, and death came to him there by the ark of God.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 6:8 And David was angry because of the Lord's outburst of wrath against Uzzah: and he
    gave that place the name Perez-uzzah, which is its name to this day.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 6:9 And such was David's fear of the Lord that day, that he said, How may I let the ark of
    God come to me?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 6:10 So David did not let the ark of the Lord come back to him to the town of David: but
    had it turned away and put into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 6:11 And the ark of the Lord was in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite for three
    months: and the Lord sent a blessing on Obed-edom and all his family.
    ---------------------Page 568---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 6:12 And they said to King David, The blessing of the Lord is on the family of Obed-
    edom and on all he has, because of the ark of God. And David went and took the ark of God from
    the house of Obed-edom into the town of David with joy.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 6:13 And when those who were lifting the ark of the Lord had gone six steps, he made an
    offering of an ox and a fat young beast.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 6:14 And David, clothed in a linen ephod, was dancing before the Lord with all his
    strength.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 6:15 So David and all the men of Israel took up the ark of the Lord with cries of joy and
    sounding of horns.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 6:16 And when the ark of the Lord came into the town of David, Michal, Saul's daughter,
    looking out of the window, saw King David dancing and jumping before the Lord; and to her mind
    he seemed foolish.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 6:17 And they took in the ark of the Lord, and put it in its place inside the tent which
    David had put up for it: and David made burned offerings and peace-offerings to the Lord.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 6:18 And after David had made the burned offerings and the peace-offerings, he gave the
    people a blessing in the name of the Lord of armies.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 6:19 And he gave to every man and woman among all the people, among all the masses
    of Israel, a cake of bread and a measure of wine and a cake of dry grapes. Then all the people went
    away, every man to his house.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 6:20 Then David came back to give a blessing to his family. And Michal, Saul's
    daughter, came out to him and said, How full of glory was the king of Israel today, who let himself
    be seen uncovered by his servant-girls like a foolish person uncovering himself without shame!

    2 </br></br>Samuel 6:21 And David said to Michal, I was dancing before the Lord, who put me over your
    father and all his sons, to make me a ruler over the people of the Lord, over his people Israel: and I
    will go on playing before the Lord;

    2 </br></br>Samuel 6:22 And I will do even worse than this, and make myself even lower in your eyes: but
    the servant-girls of whom you were talking will give me honour.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 6:23 And Michal, Saul's daughter, had no child till the day of her death.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7:1 Now when the king was living in his house, and the Lord had given him rest from
    war on every side;
    ---------------------Page 569---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7:2 The king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I am living in a house of cedar, but the
    ark of God is housed inside the curtains of a tent.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7:3 And Nathan said to the king, Go and do whatever is in your heart; for the Lord is
    with you.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7:4 Now that night the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying,

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7:5 Go and say to my servant David, The Lord says, Are you to be the builder of a house,
    a living-place for me?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7:6 For from the day when I took the children of Israel up out of Egypt till this day, I
    have had no house, but have gone from place to place in a tent.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7:7 In all the places where I went with all the children of Israel, did I ever say to any of
    the </br></br>Judges of Israel, to whom I gave the care of my people Israel, Why have you not made me a
    house of cedar?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7:8 Then say these words to my servant David, The Lord of armies says, I took you from
    the fields, from keeping the sheep, so that you might be a ruler over my people, over my people
    Israel:

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7:9 And I have been with you wherever you went, cutting off before you all those who
    were against you; and I will make your name great, like the name of the greatest ones of the earth.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7:10 And I will make a resting-place for my people Israel, planting them there, so that
    they may be living in the place which is theirs, and never again be moved; and never again will
    they be troubled by evil men as they were at the first,

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7:11 From the time when I put </br></br>Judges over my people Israel; and I will give you peace
    from all who are against you. And the Lord says to you that he will make you the head of a line of
    kings.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7:12 And when the time comes for you to go to rest with your fathers, I will put in your
    place your seed after you, the offspring of your body, and I will make his kingdom strong.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7:13 He will be the builder of a house for my name, and I will make the seat of his
    authority certain for ever.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7:14 I will be to him a father and he will be to me a son: if he does wrong, I will give
    him punishment with the rod of men and with the blows of the children of men;

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7:15 But my mercy will not be taken away from him, as I took it from him who was
    before you.
    ---------------------Page 570---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7:16 And your family and your kingdom will keep their place before me for ever: the
    seat of your authority will never be overturned.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7:17 So Nathan gave David an account of all these words and this vision.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7:18 Then David the king went in and took his seat before the Lord, and said, Who am I,
    O Lord God, and what is my family, that you have been my guide till now?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7:19 And this was only a small thing to you, O Lord God; but your words have even
    been about the far-off future of your servant's family, O Lord God!

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7:20 What more may David say to you? for you have knowledge of your servant, O Lord
    God.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7:21 Because of your word and from your heart, you have done all this great work, and
    let your servant see it.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7:22 Truly you are great, O Lord God: there is no one like you and no other God but you,
    as is clear from everything which has come to our ears.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7:23 And what other nation in the earth, like your people Israel, did a god go out to take
    for himself, to be his people, and to make a name for himself, and to do great and strange things for
    them, driving out a nation and its gods from before his people?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7:24 But you took and made strong for yourself your people Israel, to be your people for
    ever; and you, Lord, became their God.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7:25 And now, O Lord God, may the word which you have said about your servant and
    about his family, be made certain for ever, and may you do as you have said!

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7:26 And let your name be made great for ever, and let men say, The Lord of armies is
    God over Israel: and let the family of David your servant be made strong before you!

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7:27 For you, O Lord of armies, the God of Israel, have clearly said to your servant, I
    will make you the head of a family of kings: and so it has come into your servant's heart to make
    this prayer to you.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7:28 And now, O Lord God, you are God and your words are true and you have said you
    will give your servant this good thing;

    2 </br></br>Samuel 7:29 So may it be your pleasure to give your blessing to the family of your servant, so
    that it may go on for ever before you: (for you, O Lord God, have said it,) and may your blessing be
    on your servant's family line for ever!
    ---------------------Page 571---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 8

    2 </br></br>Samuel 8:1 And it came about after this that David made an attack on the Philistines and
    overcame them; and David took the authority of the mother-town from the hands of the Philistines.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 8:2 And he overcame the Moabites, and he had them measured with a line when they
    were stretched out on the earth; marking out two lines for death and one full line for life. So the
    Moabites became servants to David and gave him offerings.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 8:3 And David overcame Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, when he went to
    make his power seen by the River.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 8:4 And David took from him one thousand, seven hundred horsemen and twenty
    thousand footmen: and David had the leg-muscles of the horses cut, only keeping enough of them
    for a hundred war-carriages.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 8:5 And when the Aramaeans of Damascus came to the help of Hadadezer, king of
    Zobah, David put to the sword twenty-two thousand of the Aramaeans.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 8:6 And David put armed forces in Aram of Damascus: and the Aramaeans became
    servants to David and gave him offerings. And the Lord made David overcome wherever he went.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 8:7 And David took their gold body-covers from the servants of Hadadezer and took
    them to Jerusalem.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 8:8 And from Tebah and Berothai, towns of Hadadezer, King David took a great store of
    brass.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 8:9 And when Tou, king of Hamath, had news that David had overcome all the army of
    Hadadezer,

    2 </br></br>Samuel 8:10 He sent his son Hadoram to David, with words of peace and blessing, because he
    had overcome Hadadezer in the fight, for Hadadezer had wars with Tou; and Hadoram took with
    him vessels of silver and gold and brass:

    2 </br></br>Samuel 8:11 These King David made holy to the Lord, together with the silver and gold which
    he had taken from the nations he had overcome--

    2 </br></br>Samuel 8:12 The nations of Edom and Moab, and the children of Ammon and the Philistines and
    the Amalekites and the goods he had taken from Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 8:13 And David got great honour for himself, when he came back, by the destruction of
    Edom in the valley of Salt, to the number of eighteen thousand men.
    ---------------------Page 572---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 8:14 And he put armed forces in Edom; all through Edom he had armed forces stationed,
    and all the Edomites became servants to David. And the Lord made David overcome wherever he
    went.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 8:15 And David was king over all Israel, judging and giving right decisions for all his
    people.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 8:16 And Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the army; and Jehoshaphat, the son of
    Ahilud, was keeper of the records;

    2 </br></br>Samuel 8:17 And Zadok and Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, were priests;
    and Seraiah was the scribe;

    2 </br></br>Samuel 8:18 And Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and
    David's sons were priests.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 9

    2 </br></br>Samuel 9:1 And David said, Is there still anyone of Saul's family living, so that I may be a friend
    to him, because of Jonathan?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 9:2 Now there was of Saul's people a servant named Ziba, and they sent him to David;
    and the king said to him, Are you Ziba? And he said, I am.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 9:3 And the king said, Is there anyone of Saul's family still living, to whom I may be a
    friend in God's name? And Ziba said, There is a son of Jonathan, whose feet are damaged.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 9:4 And the king said to him, Where is he? And Ziba said to the king, He is in the house
    of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 9:5 Then King David sent, and had him taken from Lo-debar, from the house of Machir,
    the son of Ammiel.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 9:6 And Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, came to David, and falling down on his
    face, gave him honour. And David said, Mephibosheth. And answering he said, Your servant is
    here.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 9:7 And David said to him, Have no fear: for truly I will be good to you, because of your
    father Jonathan, and I will give back to you all the land which was Saul's; and you will have a place
    at my table at all times.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 9:8 And he went down on his face before the king, and said, What is your servant, for
    you to take note of a dead dog such as I am?
    ---------------------Page 573---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 9:9 Then the king sent for Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him, All the property of Saul
    and of his family I have given to your master's son.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 9:10 And you and your sons and your servants are to take care of the land for him, and
    get in the fruit of it, so that your master's son may have food: but Mephibosheth, your master's son,
    will have a place at my table at all times. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 9:11 Then Ziba said to the king, Every order which you have given to your servant will
    be done. As for Mephibosheth, he had a place at David's table, like one of the king's sons.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 9:12 And Mephibosheth had a young son named Mica. And all the people living in the
    house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 9:13 So Mephibosheth went on living in Jerusalem; for he took all his meals at the king's
    table; and he had not the use of his feet.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 10

    2 </br></br>Samuel 10:1 Now after this, death came to the king of the children of Ammon, and Hanun, his
    son, became king in his place.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 10:2 And David said, I will be a friend to Hanun, the son of Nahash, as his father was a
    friend to me. So David sent his servants, to give him words of comfort on account of his father.
    And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 10:3 But the chiefs of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, Does it seem to
    you that David is honouring your father by sending comforters to you? has he not sent his servants
    to go through the town and make secret observation of it, and overcome it?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 10:4 So Hanun took David's servants, and after cutting off half the hair on their chins,
    and cutting off the skirts of their robes up to the middle, he sent them away.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 10:5 When David had news of it, he sent men out with the purpose of meeting them on
    their way, for the men were greatly shamed: and the king said, Go to Jericho till your hair is long
    again, and then come back.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 10:6 And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves hated by
    David, they sent to the Aramaeans of Beth-rehob and Zobah, and got for payment twenty thousand
    footmen, and they got from the king of Maacah a thousand men, and from Tob twelve thousand.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 10:7 And hearing of this, David sent Joab and all the army and the best fighting-men.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 10:8 And the children of Ammon came out and put their forces in position at the way
    into the town: and the Aramaeans of Zobah and of Rehob, with the men of Tob and Maacah, were
    by themselves in the field.
    ---------------------Page 574---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 10:9 Now when Joab saw that their forces were in position against him in front and at his
    back, he took the best of the men of Israel and put them in line against the Aramaeans;

    2 </br></br>Samuel 10:10 And the rest of the people he put in position against the children of Ammon, with
    Abishai, his brother, at their head.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 10:11 And he said, If the Aramaeans are stronger and get the better of me, then you are
    to come to my help; but if the children of Ammon get the better of you, I will come to your help.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 10:12 Take heart, and let us be strong for our people and for the towns of our God, and
    may the Lord do what seems good to him.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 10:13 Then Joab and the people with him went forward to the fight against the
    Aramaeans, and they went in flight before him.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 10:14 And when the children of Ammon saw the flight of the Aramaeans, they
    themselves went in flight from Abishai, and came into the town. So Joab went back from fighting
    the children of Ammon and came to Jerusalem.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 10:15 And when the Aramaeans saw that Israel had overcome them, they got themselves
    together.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 10:16 And Hadadezer sent for the Aramaeans who were on the other side of the River:
    and they came to Helam, with Shobach, the captain of Hadadezer's army, at their head.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 10:17 And word of this was given to David: and he got all Israel together and went over
    Jordan and came to Helam. And the Aramaeans put their forces in position against David, and
    made an attack on him.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 10:18 And the Aramaeans went in flight before Israel; and David put to the sword the
    men of seven hundred Aramaean war-carriages and forty thousand footmen, and Shobach, the
    captain of the army, was wounded, and came to his death there.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 10:19 And when all the kings who were servants of Hadadezer saw that they were
    overcome by Israel, they made peace with Israel and became their servants. So the Aramaeans, in
    fear, gave no more help to the children of Ammon.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 11

    2 </br></br>Samuel 11:1 Now in the spring, at the time when kings go out to war, David sent Joab and his
    servants and all Israel with him; and they made waste the land of the children of Ammon, and took
    up their position before Rabbah, shutting it in. But David was still at Jerusalem.
    ---------------------Page 575---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 11:2 Now one evening, David got up from his bed, and while he was walking on the roof
    of the king's house, he saw from there a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 11:3 And David sent to get knowledge who the woman was. And one said, Is this not
    Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam and wife of Uriah the Hittite?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 11:4 And David sent and took her; and she came to him, and he took her to his bed: (for
    she had been made clean;) then she went back to her house.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 11:5 And the woman became with child; and she sent word to David that she was with
    child.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 11:6 And David sent to Joab saying, Send Uriah the Hittite to me. And Joab sent Uriah
    to David.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 11:7 And when Uriah came to him, David put questions to him about how Joab and the
    people were, and how the war was going.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 11:8 And David said to Uriah, Go down to your house and let your feet be washed. And
    Uriah went away from the king's house, and an offering from the king was sent after him.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 11:9 But Uriah took his rest at the door of the king's house, with all the servants of his
    lord, and did not go down to his house.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 11:10 And when word was given to David that Uriah had not gone down to his house,
    David said to Uriah, Have you not come from a journey? why did you not go down to your house?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 11:11 And Uriah said to David, Israel and Judah with the ark are living in tents, and my
    lord Joab and the other servants of my lord are sleeping in the open field; and am I to go to my
    house and take food and drink, and go to bed with my wife? By the living Lord, and by the life of
    your soul, I will not do such a thing.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 11:12 And David said to Uriah, Be here today, and after that I will let you go. So Uriah
    was in Jerusalem that day and the day after.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 11:13 And when David sent for him, he took meat and drink with him, and David made
    him the worse for drink: and when evening came, he went to rest on his bed with the servants of his
    lord, but he did not go down to his house.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 11:14 Now in the morning, David gave Uriah a letter to take to Joab.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 11:15 And in the letter he said, Take care to put Uriah in the very front of the line, where
    the fighting is most violent, and go back from him, so that he may be overcome and put to death.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 11:16 So while Joab was watching the town, he put Uriah in the place where it was clear
    to him the best fighters were.
    ---------------------Page 576---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 11:17 And the men of the town went out and had a fight with Joab: and a number of
    David's men came to their death in the fight, and with them Uriah the Hittite.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 11:18 Then Joab sent David news of everything which had taken place in the war:

    2 </br></br>Samuel 11:19 And he gave orders to the man who took the news, saying, After you have given
    the king all the news about the war,

    2 </br></br>Samuel 11:20 If the king is angry and says, Why did you go so near the town for the fight? was it
    not certain that their archers would be on the wall?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 11:21 Who put Abimelech, the son of Jerubbaal, to death? did not a woman send a great
    stone down on him from the wall, putting him to death at Thebez? why did you go so near the wall?
    Then say to him, Your servant Uriah the Hittite is among the dead.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 11:22 So the man went, and came to David, and gave him all the news which Joab had
    sent him to give; then David was angry with Joab and said, Why did you go so near the town for
    the fight? was it not certain that their archers would be on the wall? who put Abimelech, the son of
    Jerubbaal, to death? did not a woman send a great stone down on him from the wall, putting him to
    death at Thebez? why did you go so near the wall?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 11:23 And the man said to David, Truly the men got the better of us, and came out
    against us into the open country, but we sent them back to the very doors of the town.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 11:24 And the archers sent their arrows at your servants from the wall, and some of the
    king's servants are dead, and among them is your servant Uriah the Hittite.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 11:25 Then David said to the man, Go and say to Joab, Do not let this be a grief to you;
    for one man may come to his death by the sword like another: put up an even stronger fight against
    the town, and take it: and do you put heart into him.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 11:26 And when the wife of Uriah had news that her husband was dead, she gave herself
    up to weeping for him.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 11:27 And when the days of weeping were past, David sent for her, and took her into his
    house, and she became his wife and gave him a son. But the Lord was not pleased with the thing
    David had done.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:1 And the Lord sent Nathan to David. And Nathan came to him and said, There were
    two men in the same town: one a man of great wealth, and the other a poor man.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:2 The man of wealth had great </br></br>Numbers of flocks and herds;
    ---------------------Page 577---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:3 But the poor man had only one little she-lamb, which he had got and taken care of:
    from its birth it had been with him like one of his children; his meat was its food, and from his cup
    it took its drink, resting in his arms, and it was like a daughter to him.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:4 Now a traveller came to the house of the man of wealth, but he would not take
    anything from his flock or his herd to make a meal for the traveller who had come to him, but he
    took the poor man's lamb and made it ready for the man who had come.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:5 And David was full of wrath against that man; and he said to Nathan, By the living
    Lord, death is the right punishment for the man who has done this:

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:6 And he will have to give back four times the value of the lamb, because he has done
    this and because he had no pity.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:7 And Nathan said to David, You are that man. The Lord God of Israel says, I made
    you king over Israel, putting holy oil on you, and I kept you safe from the hands of Saul;

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:8 I gave you your master's daughter and your master's wives for yourself, and I gave
    you the daughters of Israel and Judah; and if that had not been enough, I would have given you
    such and such things.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:9 Why then have you had no respect for the word of the Lord, doing what is evil in
    his eyes? You have put Uriah the Hittite to death with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your
    wife; you have put him to death with the sword of the children of Ammon.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:10 So now the sword will never be turned away from your family; because you have
    had no respect for me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:11 The Lord says, From those of your family I will send evil against you, and before
    your very eyes I will take your wives and give them to your neighbour, and he will take your wives
    to his bed by the light of this sun.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:12 You did it secretly; but I will do this thing before all Israel and in the light of the
    sun.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:13 And David said to Nathan, Great is my sin against the Lord. And Nathan said to
    David, The Lord has put away your sin; death will not come on you.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:14 But still, because you have had no respect for the Lord, death will certainly
    overtake the child who has newly come to birth.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:15 Then Nathan went back to his house. And the hand of the Lord was on David's
    son, the child of Uriah's wife, and it became very ill.
    ---------------------Page 578---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:16 So David made prayer to God for the child; and he took no food day after day, and
    went in and, stretching himself out on the earth, was there all night.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:17 And the chief men of his house got up and went to his side to make him get up
    from the earth, but he would not; and he would not take food with them.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:18 And then on the seventh day the child's death took place. And David's servants
    were in fear of giving him the news of the child's death: for they said, Truly, while the child was
    still living he gave no attention when we said anything to him: what will he do to himself if we give
    him word that the child is dead?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:19 But when David saw that his servants were talking together quietly, he was certain
    that the child was dead: and he said to his servants, Is the child dead? and they said, He is.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:20 Then David got up from the earth, and after washing and rubbing himself with oil
    and changing his clothing, he went into the house of the Lord and gave worship: then he went back
    to his house, and at his order they put food before him and he had a meal.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:21 Then his servants said to him, Why have you been acting in this way? you were
    weeping and going without food while the child was still living; but when the child was dead, you
    got up and had a meal.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:22 And he said, While the child was still living I went without food and gave myself
    up to weeping: for I said, Who is able to say that the Lord will not have mercy on me and give the
    child life?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:23 But now that the child is dead there is no reason for me to go without food; am I
    able to make him come back to life? I will go to him, but he will never come back to me.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:24 And David gave comfort to his wife Bath-sheba, and he went in to her and had
    connection with her: and she had a son to whom she gave the name Solomon. And he was dear to
    the Lord.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:25 And he sent word by Nathan the prophet, who gave him the name Jedidiah, by the
    word of the Lord.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:26 Now Joab was fighting against Rabbah, in the land of the children of Ammon, and
    he took the water-town.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:27 And Joab sent men to David, saying, I have made war against Rabbah and have
    taken the water-town.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:28 So now, get the rest of the people together, and put them in position against the
    town and take it, for if I take it, it will be named after my name.
    ---------------------Page 579---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:29 Then David got all the people together and went to Rabbah and made war on it
    and took it.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:30 And he took the crown of Milcom from his head; the weight of it was a talent of
    gold, and in it were stones of great price; and it was put on David's head. And he took a great store
    of goods from the town.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 12:31 And he took the people out of the town and put them to work with wood-cutting
    instruments, and iron grain-crushers, and iron axes, and at brick-making: this he did to all the towns
    of the children of Ammon. Then David and all the people went back to Jerusalem.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:1 Now after this, it came about that Absalom, David's son, had a beautiful sister,
    whose name was Tamar; and David's son Amnon was in love with her.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:2 And he was so deeply in love that he became ill because of his sister Tamar; for she
    was a virgin, and so it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:3 But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's
    brother: and Jonadab was a very wise man.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:4 And he said to him, O son of the king, why are you getting thinner day by day? will
    you not say what your trouble is? And Amnon said to him, I am in love with Tamar, my brother
    Absalom's sister.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:5 Then Jonadab said to him, Go to your bed, and let it seem that you are ill: and when
    your father comes to see you, say to him, Let my sister Tamar come and give me bread, and get the
    food ready before my eyes, so that I may see it and take it from her hand.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:6 So Amnon went to bed and made himself seem ill: and when the king came to see
    him, Amnon said to the king, Please let my sister Tamar come and make me one or two cakes
    before my eyes, so that I may take food from her hand.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:7 Then David sent to the house for Tamar and said, Go now to your brother Amnon's
    house and get a meal for him.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:8 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was in bed. And she took
    paste and made cakes before his eyes, cooking them over the fire.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:9 And she took the cooking-pot, and put the cakes before him, but he would not take
    them. And Amnon said, Let everyone go away from me. So they all went out.
    ---------------------Page 580---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:10 Then Amnon said to Tamar, Take the food and come into my bedroom, so that I
    may take it from your hand. So Tamar took the cakes she had made and went with them into her
    brother Amnon's bedroom.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:11 And when she took them to give them to him, he put his arms round her and said,
    Come to bed, my sister.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:12 And answering him, she said, O my brother, do not put shame on me; it is not right
    for such a thing to be done in Israel: do not this evil thing.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:13 What will become of me in my shame? and as for you, you will be looked down
    on with disgust by all Israel. Now then, go and make your request to the king, for he will not keep
    me from you.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:14 But he would not give attention to what she said: but being stronger than she, he
    took her by force, and had connection with her.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:15 Then Amnon was full of hate for her, hating her with a hate greater than his earlier
    love for her. And he said to her, Get up and be gone.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:16 And she said to him, Not so, my brother, for this great wrong in sending me away
    is worse than what you did to me before. But he gave no attention to her.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:17 Then he gave a cry to the servant who was waiting on him and said, Put this
    woman out, and let the door be locked after her.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:18 Now she had on a long robe, such as in past times the king's virgin daughters were
    dressed in. Then the servant put her out, locking the door after her.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:19 And Tamar, in her grief, put dust on her head; and she put her hand on her head
    and went away crying loudly.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:20 And her brother Absalom said to her, Has your brother Amnon been with you? but
    now, let there be an end to your crying, my sister: he is your brother, do not take this thing to heart.
    So Tamar went on living uncomforted in her brother's house.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:21 But when King David had news of all these things he was very angry; but he did
    not make trouble for Amnon his son, for he was dear to David, being his oldest son.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:22 But Absalom said nothing to his brother Amnon, good or bad: for he was full of
    hate for him, because he had taken his sister Tamar by force.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:23 Now after two full years, Absalom had men cutting the wool of his sheep in Baal-
    hazor, which is near Ephraim: and he sent for all the king's sons to come to his feast.
    ---------------------Page 581---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:24 And Absalom came to the king and said, See now, your servant is cutting the wool
    of his sheep; will the king and his servants be pleased to come?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:25 And the king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all go, or the number will be
    over-great for you. And he made his request again, but he would not go, but he gave him his
    blessing.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:26 Then Absalom said, If you will not go, then let my brother Amnon go with us.
    And the king said to him, Is there any reason for him to go with you?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:27 But Absalom went on requesting him till he let Amnon and all the king's sons go
    with him. And Absalom made a great feast like a feast for a king.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:28 Now Absalom had given orders to his servants, saying, Now take note when
    Amnon's heart is glad with wine; and when I say to you, Make an attack on Amnon, then put him to
    death without fear: have I not given you orders? be strong and without fear.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:29 So Absalom's servants did to Amnon as Absalom had given them orders. Then all
    the king's sons got up, and every man got on his beast and went in flight.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:30 Now while they were on their way, news was given to David that Absalom had put
    to death all the sons of the king and that not one of them was still living.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:31 Then the king got up in great grief, stretching himself out on the earth: and all his
    servants were by his side, with their clothing parted.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:32 And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother, said, Let not my lord have the
    idea that all the sons of the king have been put to death; for only Amnon is dead: this has been
    purposed by Absalom from the day when he took his sister Tamar by force.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:33 So now, let not my lord the king take this thing to heart, with the idea that all the
    king's sons are dead: for only Amnon is dead.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:34 But Absalom went in flight. And the young man who kept the watch, lifting up his
    eyes, saw that a great band of people was coming down the slope by the way of the Horons; and the
    watchman came and gave word to the king, saying, I saw men coming down by the way of the
    Horons, from the hillside.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:35 And Jonadab said to the king, See, the king's sons are coming; as your servant
    said, so it is.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:36 And while he was talking, the king's sons came, with weeping and loud cries: and
    the king and all his servants were weeping bitterly.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:37 So Absalom went in flight and came to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, the king of
    Geshur, where he was for three years.
    ---------------------Page 582---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:38 And the king was sorrowing for his son all the time.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 13:39 And the heart of David was wasted with desire for Absalom: for he was comforted
    for the death of Amnon.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:1 Now it was clear to Joab, the son of Zeruiah, that the king's heart was turning to
    Absalom.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:2 And Joab sent to Tekoa and got from there a wise woman, and said to her, Now
    make yourself seem like one given up to grief, and put on the clothing of sorrow, not using any
    sweet oil for your body, but looking like one who for a long time has been weeping for the dead:

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:3 And come to the king and say these words to him. So Joab gave her words to say.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:4 And the woman of Tekoa came to the king, and falling on her face, gave him
    honour and said, Give me help, O king.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:5 And the king said to her, What is your trouble? And her answer was, Truly I am a
    widow, and my husband is dead.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:6 And I had two sons, and the two of them had a fight in the field, and there was no
    one to come between them, and one with a blow put the other to death.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:7 And now all the family is turned against me, your servant, saying, Give up him who
    was the cause of his brother's death, so that we may put him to death in payment for the life of his
    brother, whose life he took; and we will put an end to the one who will get the heritage: so they will
    put out my last burning coal, and my husband will have no name or offspring on the face of the
    earth.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:8 And the king said to the woman, Go to your house and I will give orders about this.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:9 And the woman of Tekoa said to the king, My lord, O king, may the sin be on me
    and on my family, and may the king and the seat of his kingdom be clear of sin!

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:10 And the king said, If anyone says anything to you, make him come to me, and he
    will do you no more damage.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:11 Then she said, Let the king keep in mind the Lord your God, so that he who gives
    punishment for blood may be kept back from further destruction and that no one may send death on
    my son. And he said, By the living Lord, not a hair of your son's head will come to the earth.
    ---------------------Page 583---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:12 Then the woman said, Will the king let his servant say one word more? And he
    said, Say on.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:13 And the woman said, Why have you had such a thought about the people of God?
    (for in saying these very words the king has put himself in the wrong because he has not taken back
    the one whom he sent far away.)

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:14 For death comes to us all, and we are like water drained out on the earth, which it
    is not possible to take up again; and God will not take away the life of the man whose purpose is
    that he who has been sent away may not be completely cut off from him.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:15 And now it is my fear of the people which has made me come to say these words
    to my lord the king: and your servant said, I will put my cause before the king, and it may be that
    he will give effect to my request.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:16 For the king will give ear, and take his servant out of the power of the man whose
    purpose is the destruction of me and my son together from the heritage of God.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:17 Then your servant said, May the word of my lord the king give me peace! for my
    lord the king is as the angel of God in his hearing of good and bad: and may the Lord your God be
    with you!

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:18 Then the king said to the woman, Now give me an answer to the question I am
    going to put to you; keep nothing back. And the woman said, Let my lord the king say on.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:19 And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with you in all this? And the woman in
    answer said, By the life of your soul, my lord the king, it is not possible for anyone to go to the
    right hand or to the left from anything said by the king: your servant Joab gave me orders, and put
    all these words in my mouth:

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:20 This he did, hoping that the face of this business might be changed: and my lord is
    wise, with the wisdom of the angel of God, having knowledge of everything on earth.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:21 And the king said to Joab, See now, I will do this thing: go then and Come back
    with the young man Absalom.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:22 Then Joab, falling down on his face on the earth, gave the king honour and
    blessing; and Joab said, Today it is clear to your servant that I have grace in your eyes, my lord
    king, because the king has given effect to the request of his servant.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:23 So Joab got up and went to Geshur and came back again to Jerusalem with
    Absalom.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:24 And the king said, Let him go to his house, but let him not see my face. So
    Absalom went back to his house and did not see the face of the king.
    ---------------------Page 584---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:25 Now in all Israel there was no one so greatly to be praised for his beautiful form as
    Absalom: from his feet to the crown of his head he was completely beautiful.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:26 And when he had his hair cut, (which he did at the end of every year, because of
    the weight of his hair;) the weight of the hair was two hundred shekels by the king's weight.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:27 And Absalom was the father of three sons and of one daughter named Tamar, who
    was very beautiful.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:28 For two full years Absalom was living in Jerusalem without ever seeing the face of
    the king.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:29 Then Absalom sent for Joab to send him to the king, but he would not come to
    him: and he sent again a second time, but he would not come.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:30 So he said to his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he has barley in it; go
    and put it on fire. And Absalom's servants put the field on fire.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:31 Then Joab came to Absalom in his house and said to him, Why have your servants
    put my field on fire?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:32 And Absalom's answer was, See, I sent to you saying, Come here, so that I may
    send you to the king to say, Why have I come back from Geshur? it would be better for me to be
    there still: let me now see the king's face, and if there is any sin in me, let him put me to death.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 14:33 So Joab went to the king and said these words to him: and when the king had sent
    for him, Absalom came, and went down on his face on the earth before the king: and the king gave
    him a kiss.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:1 Now after this, Absalom got for himself a carriage and horses, and fifty runners to
    go before him.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:2 And Absalom got up early, morning after morning, and took his place at the side of
    the public meeting-place: and when any man had a cause which had to come to the king to be
    judged, then Absalom, crying out to him, said, What is your town? and he would say, Your servant
    is of one of the tribes of Israel.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:3 And Absalom would say to him, See, your cause is true and right; but no man has
    been named by the king to give you a hearing.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:4 And more than this, Absalom said, If only I was made judge in the land, so that
    every man who has any cause or question might come to me, and I would give a right decision for
    him!
    ---------------------Page 585---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:5 And if any man came near to give him honour, he took him by the hand and gave
    him a kiss.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:6 And this Absalom did to everyone in Israel who came to the king to have his cause
    judged: so Absalom, like a thief, took away the hearts of the men of Israel.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:7 Now at the end of four years, Absalom said to the king, Let me go to Hebron and
    give effect to the oath which I made to the Lord:

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:8 For while I was living in Geshur in Aram, your servant made an oath, saying, If
    ever the Lord lets me come back to Jerusalem, I will give him worship in Hebron.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:9 And the king said to him, Go in peace. So he got up and went to Hebron.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:10 But Absalom at the same time sent watchers through all the tribes of Israel to say,
    At the sound of the horn you are to say, Absalom is king in Hebron.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:11 And with Absalom, at his request, went two hundred men from Jerusalem, who
    were completely unconscious of his designs.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:12 And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, one of David's helpers, from Giloh
    his town, while he was making the offerings. And the design against David became strong, for
    more and more people were joined to Absalom.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:13 And one came to David and said, The hearts of the men of Israel have gone after
    Absalom.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:14 And David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, Come, let us
    go in flight, or not one of us will be safe from Absalom: let us go without loss of time, or he will
    overtake us quickly and send evil on us, and put the town to the sword.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:15 And the king's servants said to the king, See, your servants are ready to do
    whatever the king says is to be done.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:16 So the king went out, taking with him all the people of his house, but for ten of his
    women, who were to take care of the house.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:17 And the king went out, and all his servants went after him, and made a stop at the
    Far House.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:18 And all the people went on by his side; and all the Cherethites and all the
    Pelethites and all the men of Ittai of Gath, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, went on
    before the king.
    ---------------------Page 586---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:19 Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, Why are you coming with us? go back and
    keep with the king: for you are a man of another country, you are far from the land of your birth.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:20 It was only yesterday you came to us; why then am I to make you go up and down
    with us? for I have to go where I may; go back then, and take your countrymen with you, and may
    the Lord's mercy and good faith be with you.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:21 And Ittai the Gittite in answer said, By the living Lord, and by the life of my lord
    the king, in whatever place my lord the king may be, for life or death, there will your servant be.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:22 And David said to Ittai, Go forward, then. And Ittai the Gittite went on, with all
    his men and all the little ones he had with him.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:23 And there was great weeping in all the country when all the people went through;
    and the king himself was waiting in the Kidron valley and all the people went by him in the
    direction of the olive-tree on the edge of the waste land.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:24 Then Zadok came, and Abiathar, and with them the ark of God's agreement: and
    they put down the ark of God, till all the people from the town had gone by.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:25 And the king said to Zadok, Take the ark of God back into the town: if I have
    grace in the eyes of the Lord, he will let me come back and see it and his House again:

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:26 But if he says, I have no delight in you: then, here I am; let him do to me what
    seems good to him.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:27 The king said further to Zadok the priest, See, you and Abiathar are to go back to
    the town in peace, with your two sons, Ahimaaz, your son, and Jonathan, the son of Abiathar.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:28 See, I will be waiting at the way across the river, in the waste land, till I get news
    from you.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:29 So Zadok and Abiathar took the ark of God back to Jerusalem, and did not go
    away from there.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:30 And David went up the slopes of the Mount of Olives weeping all the way, with
    his head covered and no shoes on his feet: and all the people who were with him, covering their
    heads, went up weeping.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:31 And word came to David, saying, Ahithophel is among those who are joined to
    Absalom. And David said, O Lord, let the wisdom of Ahithophel be made foolish.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:32 Now when David had come to the top of the slope, where they gave worship to
    God, Hushai the Archite came to him in great grief with dust on his head:

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:33 David said to him, If you go on with me, you will be a trouble to me:
    ---------------------Page 587---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:34 But if you go back to the town and say to Absalom, I will be your servant, O king;
    as in the past I have been your father's servant, so now I will be yours: then you will be able to keep
    Ahithophel's designs against me from being put into effect.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:35 And have you not there Zadok and Abiathar the priests? so whatever comes to
    your ears from the king's house, give word of it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:36 See, they have with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, and Jonathan, the
    son of Abiathar; by them you may send word to me of everything which comes to your ears.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 15:37 So Hushai, David's friend, went into the town, and Absalom came to Jerusalem.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 16

    2 </br></br>Samuel 16:1 And when David had gone a little way past the top of the slope, Ziba, the servant of
    Mephibosheth, came to him, with two asses on which were two hundred cakes of bread and a
    hundred stems of dry grapes and a hundred summer fruits and a skin of wine.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 16:2 And David said to Ziba, What is your reason for this? And Ziba said, The asses are
    for the use of the king's people, and the bread and the fruit are food for the young men; and the
    wine is for drink for those who are overcome by weariness in the waste land.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 16:3 And the king said, And where is your master's son? And Ziba said, He is still at
    Jerusalem: for he said, Today Israel will give back to me the kingdom of my father.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 16:4 Then the king said to Ziba, Truly everything which was Mephibosheth's is yours.
    And Ziba said, I give honour to my lord, may I have grace in your eyes, my lord, O king!

    2 </br></br>Samuel 16:5 And when King David came to Bahurim, a man of Saul's family named Shimei, the
    son of Gera, came out from there, calling curses after him.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 16:6 And he sent stones at David and at all the king's servants and at all the people and at
    all the men of war by his side, on the right hand and on the left.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 16:7 And Shimei said, with curses, Be gone, be gone, you man of blood, you good-for-
    nothing:

    2 </br></br>Samuel 16:8 The Lord has sent punishment on you for all the blood of the family of Saul, whose
    kingdom you have taken; and the Lord has given the kingdom to Absalom, your son: now you
    yourself are taken in your evil, because you are a man of blood.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 16:9 Then Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, said to the king, Is this dead dog to go on cursing
    my lord the king? let me go over and take off his head.
    ---------------------Page 588---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 16:10 And the king said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? Let him go
    on cursing, for the Lord has said, Put a curse on David, and who then may say, Why have you done
    so?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 16:11 And David said to Abishai and to all his servants, You see how my son, the
    offspring of my body, has made designs against my life: how much more then may this Benjamite
    do so? Let him be, and let him go on cursing; for the Lord has given him orders.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 16:12 It may be that the Lord will take note of my wrongs, and give me back good in
    answer to his cursing of me today.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 16:13 So David and his men went on their way: and Shimei went by the hillside parallel
    with them, cursing and sending stones and dust at him.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 16:14 And the king and his people came tired to Jordan, and took their rest there.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 16:15 And Absalom and the men of Israel came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with
    him.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 16:16 Then Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Absalom and said, Long life to
    the king, long life to the king!

    2 </br></br>Samuel 16:17 And Absalom said, Is this your love for your friend? why did you not go with your
    friend?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 16:18 And Hushai said to Absalom, Not so; I am for that man whom the Lord and this
    people and all the men of Israel have taken as king, and I will take my place with him.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 16:19 And more than this! where is my place as a servant? is it not before his son? as I
    have been your father's servant, so will I be yours.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 16:20 Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, Give your opinion now, what are we to do?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 16:21 And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to your father's women who are here
    looking after his house; then all Israel will have the news that you are hated by your father, and the
    hands of your supporters will be strong.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 16:22 So they put up the tent for Absalom on the top of the house, and Absalom went in
    to his father's women before the eyes of all Israel.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 16:23 In those days the opinions of Ahithophel were valued as highly as if through him a
    man might get direction from God; so were they valued by David as much as by Absalom.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17
    ---------------------Page 589---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17:1 Then Ahithophel said to Absalom, Let me take out twelve thousand men and this
    very night I will go after David:

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17:2 And I will come up with him when he is tired and feeble, and make him full of fear:
    and all the people with him will go in flight; and I will make an attack on the king only:

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17:3 And I will make all the people come back to you as a bride comes back to her
    husband: it is the life of only one man you are going after; so all the people will be at peace.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17:4 And the saying was pleasing to Absalom and to the responsible men of Israel.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17:5 Then Absalom said, Now send for Hushai the Archite, and let us give ear to what he
    has to say.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17:6 And when Hushai came, Absalom said to him, This is what Ahithophel has said: are
    we to do as he says? if not, what is your suggestion?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17:7 And Hushai said to Absalom, Ahithophel's idea is not a good one at this time.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17:8 Hushai said further, You have knowledge of your father and his men, that they are
    men of war, and that their feelings are bitter, like those of a bear in the field whose young ones
    have been taken from her: and your father is a man of war, and will not take his night's rest with the
    people;

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17:9 But he will certainly have taken cover now in some hole or secret place; and if
    some of our people, at the first attack, are overcome, then any hearing of it will say, There is
    destruction among the people who are on Absalom's side.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17:10 Then even the strongest, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will become like
    water; for all Israel is conscious that your father is a man of war, and those who are with him are
    strong and without fear.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17:11 But my suggestion is that all Israel, from Dan as far as Beer-sheba, comes together
    to you, a great army like the sands of the sea in number; and that you yourself go out among them.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17:12 Then we will come on him in some place, wherever he may be, falling on him as
    the dew comes on the earth: and of him and all the men who are with him not one will get away
    with his life.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17:13 And if he has gone into some town, then let all Israel take strong cords to that
    town, and we will have it pulled into the valley, till not one small stone is to be seen there.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17:14 Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, Hushai's suggestion is better than
    that of Ahithophel. For it was the purpose of the Lord to make the wise designs of Ahithophel
    without effect, so that the Lord might send evil on Absalom.
    ---------------------Page 590---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17:15 Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, This is the suggestion made
    by Ahithophel to Absalom and the responsible men of Israel, and this is what I said to them.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17:16 So now send the news quickly to David, and say, Do not take your night's rest by
    the way across the river to the waste land, but be certain to go over; or the king and all the people
    with him will come to destruction.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17:17 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were waiting by En-rogel; and a servant-girl went
    from time to time and gave them news and they went with the news to King David, for it was not
    wise for them to let themselves be seen coming into the town.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17:18 But a boy saw them, and gave word of it to Absalom: so the two of them went
    away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim who had a water-hole in his garden, and
    they went down into it.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17:19 And a woman put a cover over the hole, and put crushed grain on top of it, and no
    one had any knowledge of it.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17:20 And Absalom's servants came to the woman at the house and said, Where are
    Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said to them, They have gone from here to the stream.
    And after searching for them, and seeing nothing of them, they went back to Jerusalem.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17:21 Then after the servants had gone away, they came up out of the water-hole and
    went to give King David the news; and they said, Get up and go quickly over the water, for such
    and such are Ahithophel's designs against you.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17:22 So David and all the people who were with him went up over Jordan: when dawn
    came, every one of them had gone over Jordan.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17:23 Now when Ahithophel saw that his suggestion was not acted on, he got his ass
    ready, and went back to his house, to the town where he came from, and having put his house in
    order, he put himself to death by hanging; so he came to his end and was put in the resting-place of
    his father.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17:24 And David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom, with all the men of Israel, went
    over Jordan.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17:25 And Absalom put Amasa at the head of the army in place of Joab. Now Amasa
    was the son of a man named Ithra the Ishmaelite, who had been the lover of Abigail, the daughter
    of Jesse, sister of Zeruiah, Joab's mother.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17:26 And Israel and Absalom put up their tents in the land of Gilead.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17:27 Now when David had come to Mahanaim, Shobi, the son of Nahash of Rabbah,
    the Ammonite, and Machir, the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,
    ---------------------Page 591---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17:28 Came with beds and basins and pots, and grain and meal, and all sorts of dry
    foods,

    2 </br></br>Samuel 17:29 And honey and butter and sheep and milk-cheeses, for David and his people: for
    they said, This people is in the waste land, needing food and drink and rest.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:1 And David had the people who were with him numbered, and he put over them
    captains of thousands and captains of hundreds.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:2 And David sent the people out, a third of them under the orders of Joab, and a third
    under the orders of Abishai, son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third under Ittai the Gittite. And
    the king said to the people, And I myself will certainly go out with you.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:3 But the people said, It is better for you not to go out: for if we are put to flight, they
    will not give a thought to us, and if death overtakes half of us, it will be nothing to them: but you
    are of more value than ten thousand of us: so it is better for you to be ready to come to our help
    from this town.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:4 And the king said to them, I will do whatever seems best to you. So the king took
    his place by the door of the town, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:5 And the king gave orders to Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Because of me, be
    gentle to the young man Absalom. And this order about Absalom was given in the hearing of all the
    people.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:6 So the people went out into the field against Israel, and the fight took place in the
    woods of Ephraim.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:7 And the people of Israel were overcome there by the servants of David, and there
    was a great destruction that day, and twenty thousand men were put to the sword.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:8 And the fighting went on over all the face of the country: and the woods were
    responsible for more deaths than the sword.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:9 And Absalom came across some of David's men. And Absalom was seated on his
    mule, and the mule went under the thick branches of a great tree, and his head became fixed in the
    tree and he was lifted up between earth and heaven, and the beast under him went on.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:10 And a certain man saw it and said to Joab, I saw Absalom hanging in a tree.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:11 And Joab said to the man who had given him the news, If you saw this, why did
    you not put your sword through him, and I would have given you ten bits of silver and a band for
    your robe?
    ---------------------Page 592---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:12 And the man said to Joab, Even if you gave me a thousand bits of silver, I would
    not put out my hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king gave orders to you and
    Abishai and Ittai, saying, Take care that the young man Absalom is not touched.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:13 And if I had falsely put him to death (and nothing may be kept secret from the
    king), you would have had nothing to do with me.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:14 Then Joab said, I would have made it safe for you. And he took three spears in his
    hand, and put them through Absalom's heart, while he was still living, in the branches of the tree.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:15 And ten young men, servants of Joab, came round Absalom and put an end to him.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:16 And Joab had the horn sounded, and the people came back from going after Israel,
    for Joab kept them back.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:17 And they took Absalom's body and put it into a great hole in the wood, and put a
    great mass of stones over it: and every man of Israel went in flight to his tent.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:18 Now Absalom, before his death, had put up for himself a pillar in the king's valley,
    naming it after himself; for he said, I have no son to keep my name in memory: and to this day it is
    named Absalom's pillar.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:19 Then Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, said, Let me go and give the king news of how
    the Lord has done right in his cause against those who took up arms against him.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:20 And Joab said, You will take no news today; another day you may give him the
    news, but you will take no news today, because the king's son is dead.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:21 Then Joab said to the Cushite, Go and give the king word of what you have seen.
    And the Cushite, making a sign of respect to Joab, went off running.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:22 Then Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, said to Joab again, Whatever may come of it, let
    me go after the Cushite. And Joab said, Why have you a desire to go, my son, seeing that you will
    get no reward for your news?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:23 Whatever may come of it, he said, I will go. Then he said to him, Go. So Ahimaaz
    went running by the lowland road and overtook the Cushite.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:24 Now David was seated between the two town doors; and the watchman went up to
    the roof of the doorways, on the wall, and, lifting up his eyes, saw a man running by himself.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:25 And the watchman gave news of it to the king. And the king said, If he is coming
    by himself, then he has news. And the man was travelling quickly, and came near.
    ---------------------Page 593---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:26 Then the watchman saw another man running: and crying out in the direction of
    the door he said, Here is another man running by himself. And the king said, He, like the other,
    comes with news.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:27 And the watchman said, It seems to me that the running of the first is like the
    running of Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and his news will be
    good.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:28 And Ahimaaz, crying out to the king, said, It is well. And falling down before the
    king, with his face to the earth, he said, May the Lord your God be praised, who has given up the
    men who took up arms against my lord the king!

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:29 And the king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And Ahimaaz said in
    answer, When Joab sent me, your servant, I saw a great outcry going on, but I had no knowledge of
    what it was.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:30 And the king said, Get back and take your place here. So turning to one side, he
    took his place there.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:31 And then the Cushite came and said, I have news for my lord the king: today the
    Lord has done right in your cause against all those who took up arms against you.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:32 And the king said to the Cushite, Is the young man Absalom safe? And the Cushite
    said in answer, May all the king's haters and those who do evil against the king, be as that young
    man is!

    2 </br></br>Samuel 18:33 Then the king was much moved, and went up into the room over the door,
    weeping, and saying, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! if only my life might have
    been given for yours, O Absalom, my son, my son!

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:1 And word was given to Joab that the king was weeping and sorrowing for Absalom.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:2 And the salvation of that day was changed to sorrow for all the people: for it was
    said to the people, The king is in bitter grief for his son.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:3 And the people made their way back to the town quietly and secretly, as those who
    are shamed go secretly when they go in flight from the war.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:4 But the king, covering his face, gave a great cry, O my son Absalom, O Absalom,
    my son, my son!
    ---------------------Page 594---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:5 And Joab came into the house to the king and said, Today you have put to shame
    the faces of all your servants who even now have kept you and your sons and your daughters and
    your wives and all your women safe from death;

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:6 For your haters, it seems, are dear to you, and your friends are hated. For you have
    made it clear that captains and servants are nothing to you: and now I see that if Absalom was
    living and we had all been dead today, it would have been right in your eyes.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:7 So get up now, and go out and say some kind words to your servants; for, by the
    Lord, I give you my oath, that if you do not go out, not one of them will keep with you tonight; and
    that will be worse for you than all the evil which has overtaken you from your earliest years.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:8 Then the king got up and took his seat near the town-door. And word was given to
    all the people that the king was in the public place: and all the people came before the king. Now
    all the men of Israel had gone back in flight to their tents.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:9 And through all the tribes of Israel the people were having arguments, saying, The
    king made us safe from the hands of those who were against us and made us free from the hands of
    the Philistines; and now he has gone in flight from the land, because of Absalom.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:10 And Absalom, whom we made a ruler over us, is dead in the fight. So now why do
    you say nothing about getting the king back? And word of what all Israel was saying came to the
    king.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:11 And King David sent word to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, Say to the
    responsible men of Judah, Why are you the last to take steps to get the king back to his house?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:12 You are my brothers, my bone and my flesh; why are you the last to get the king
    back again?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:13 And say to Amasa, Are you not my bone and my flesh? May God's punishment be
    on me, if I do not make you chief of the army before me at all times in place of Joab!

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:14 And the hearts of the men of Judah were moved like one man; so that they sent to
    the king, saying, Come back, with all your servants.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:15 So the king came back, and came as far as Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal,
    meeting the king there, to take him back with them over Jordan.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:16 And Shimei, the son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, got up quickly and
    went down with the men of Judah for the purpose of meeting King David;

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:17 And with him a thousand men of Benjamin, and Ziba, the servant of Saul, with his
    fifteen sons and twenty servants, came rushing to Jordan before the king,
    ---------------------Page 595---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:18 And kept going across the river to take the people of the king's house over, and to
    do whatever was desired by the king. And Shimei, the son of Gera, went down on his face in the
    dust before the king, when he was about to go over Jordan,

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:19 And said to him, Let me not be judged as a sinner in your eyes, O my lord, and do
    not keep in mind the wrong I did on the day when my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, or take it
    to heart.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:20 For your servant is conscious of his sin: and so, as you see, I have come today, the
    first of all the sons of Joseph, for the purpose of meeting my lord the king.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:21 But Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, said, Is not death the right fate for Shimei,
    because he has been cursing the one marked by the holy oil?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:22 And David said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you put
    yourselves against me today? is it right for any man in Israel to be put to death today? for I am
    certain today that I am king in Israel.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:23 So the king said to Shimei, You will not be put to death. And the king gave him
    his oath.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:24 And Mephibosheth, the son of Saul's son, came down for the purpose of meeting
    the king; his feet had not been cared for or his hair cut or his clothing washed from the day when
    the king went away till the day when he came back in peace.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:25 Now when he had come from Jerusalem to see the king, the king said to him, Why
    did you not come with me, Mephibosheth?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:26 And he said in answer, Because of the deceit of my servant, my lord king: for I,
    your servant, said to him, You are to make ready an ass and on it I will go with the king, for your
    servant has not the use of his feet.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:27 He has given you a false account of me: but my lord the king is like the angel of
    God: do then whatever seems good to you.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:28 For all my father's family were only dead men before my lord the king: and still
    you put your servant among those whose place is at the king's table. What right then have I to say
    anything more to the king?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:29 And the king said, Say nothing more about these things. I say, Let there be a
    division of the land between Ziba and you.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:30 And Mephibosheth said, Let him take it all, now that my lord the king has come
    back to his house in peace!
    ---------------------Page 596---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:31 And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went on as far as
    Jordan with the king to take him across Jordan.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:32 Now Barzillai was a very old man, as much as eighty years old: and he had given
    the king everything he had need of, while he was at Mahanaim, for he was a very great man.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:33 And the king said to Barzillai, Come over with me, and I will take care of you in
    Jerusalem.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:34 And Barzillai said to the king, How much of my life is still before me, for me to
    go up to Jerusalem with the king?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:35 I am now eighty years old: good and bad are the same to me; have meat and drink
    any taste for me now? am I able to take pleasure in the voices of men or women in song? why then
    am I to be a trouble to my lord the king?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:36 Your servant's desire was only to take the king over Jordan; why is the king to
    give me such a reward?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:37 Let your servant now go back again, so that when death comes to me, it may be in
    my town and by the resting-place of my father and mother. But here is your servant Chimham: let
    him go with my lord the king, and do for him what seems good to you.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:38 And the king said in answer, Let Chimham go over with me, and I will do for him
    whatever seems good to you: and whatever your desire is, I will do it for you.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:39 Then all the people went over Jordan, and the king went over: and the king gave
    Barzillai a kiss, with his blessing; and he went back to his place.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:40 So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went with him: and all the people
    of Judah, as well as half the people of Israel, took the king on his way.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:41 Then the men of Israel came to the king and said, Why have our countrymen of
    Judah taken you away in secret and come over Jordan with the king and all his family, because all
    his people are David's men?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:42 And all the men of Judah gave this answer to the men of Israel, Because the king
    is our near relation: why then are you angry about this? have we taken any of the king's food, or has
    he given us any offering?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 19:43 And in answer to the men of Judah, the men of Israel said, We have ten parts in
    the king, and we are the first in order of birth: why did you make nothing of us? and were we not
    the first to make suggestions for getting the king back? And the words of the men of Judah were
    more violent than the words of the men of Israel.
    ---------------------Page 597---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 20

    2 </br></br>Samuel 20:1 Now by chance there was present a good-for-nothing person named Sheba, the son
    of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he, sounding the horn, said, We have no part in David, or any interest in
    the son of Jesse: let every man go to his tent, O Israel.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 20:2 So all the men of Israel, turning away from David, went after Sheba, the son of
    Bichri: but the men of Judah were true to their king, going with him from Jordan as far as
    Jerusalem.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 20:3 And David came to his house at Jerusalem: and the king took the ten women to
    whom he had given the care of the house, and had them shut up, and gave them the necessaries of
    life, but did not go near them. So they were shut up till the day of their death, living as widows.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 20:4 Then the king said to Amasa, Get all the men of Judah together, and in three days
    be here yourself.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 20:5 So Amasa went to get all the men of Judah together, but he took longer than the
    time David had given him.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 20:6 And David said to Abishai, Sheba, the son of Bichri, will do us more damage than
    Absalom did; so take some of your lord's servants and go after him, before he makes himself safe in
    the walled towns, and gets away before our eyes.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 20:7 So there went after Abishai, Joab and the Cherethites and the Pelethites and all the
    fighting-men; they went out of Jerusalem to overtake Sheba, the son of Bichri.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 20:8 When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came face to face
    with them. Now Joab had on his war-dress, and round him a band from which his sword was
    hanging in its cover; and while he was walking, it came out, falling to the earth.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 20:9 And Joab said to Amasa, Is it well, my brother? And with his right hand he took
    him by the hair of his chin to give him a kiss.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 20:10 But Amasa did not see danger from the sword which was now in Joab's left hand,
    and Joab put it through his stomach so that his inside came out on to the earth, and he did not give
    him another blow. So Joab and his brother Abishai went on after Sheba, the son of Bichri.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 20:11 And one of Joab's young men, taking his place at Amasa's side, said, Whoever is
    for Joab and for David, let him go after Joab!

    2 </br></br>Samuel 20:12 And Amasa was stretched out in a pool of blood in the middle of the highway.
    And when the man saw that all the people were stopping, he took Amasa out of the highway and
    put him in a field, with a cloth over him, when he saw that everyone who went by came to a stop.
    ---------------------Page 598---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 20:13 When he had been taken off the road, all the people went on after Joab in search of
    Sheba, the son of Bichri.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 20:14 And Sheba went through all the tribes of Israel, to Abel of Beth-maacah; and all
    the Bichrites came together and went in after him.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 20:15 And Joab and his men got him shut up in Abel of Beth-maacah, and put up an
    earthwork against the town: and all Joab's men did their best to get the wall broken down.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 20:16 Then a wise woman got up on the wall, and crying out from the town, said, Give
    ear, give ear; say now to Joab, Come near, so that I may have talk with you.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 20:17 And he came near, and the woman said, Are you Joab? And he said in answer, I
    am. Then she said, Give ear to your servant's words. And he said, I am giving ear.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 20:18 Then she said, In the old days, there was a saying, Let them put the question in
    Abel and in Dan, saying, Has what was ordered by men of good faith in Israel ever come to an end?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 20:19 Your purpose is the destruction of a mother-town in Israel: why would you put an
    end to the heritage of the Lord?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 20:20 And Joab, answering her, said, Far, far be it from me to be a cause of death or
    destruction;

    2 </br></br>Samuel 20:21 Not so: but a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, Sheba, son of Bichri, by name,
    has taken up arms against the king, against David: give up this man only, and I will go away from
    the town. And the woman said to Joab, His head will be dropped over the wall to you.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 20:22 Then the woman in her wisdom had talk with all the town. And they had Sheba's
    head cut off and sent out to Joab. And he had the horn sounded, and sent them all away from the
    town, every man to his tent. And Joab went back to Jerusalem to the king.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 20:23 Now Joab was over all the army; and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was at the head
    of the Cherethites and the Pelethites;

    2 </br></br>Samuel 20:24 And Adoram was overseer of the forced work; and Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud,
    was the recorder;

    2 </br></br>Samuel 20:25 And Sheva was the scribe, and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;

    2 </br></br>Samuel 20:26 And in addition, Ira the Jairite was a priest to David.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 21
    ---------------------Page 599---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 21:1 In the days of David they were short of food for three years, year after year; and
    David went before the Lord for directions. And the Lord said, On Saul and on his family there is
    blood, because he put the Gibeonites to death.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 21:2 Then the king sent for the Gibeonites; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children
    of Israel, but were the last of the Amorites, to whom the children of Israel had given an oath; but
    Saul, in his passion for the children of Israel and Judah, had made an attempt on their lives:)

    2 </br></br>Samuel 21:3 So David said to the Gibeonites, What may I do for you? how am I to make up to
    you for your wrongs, so that you may give a blessing to the heritage of the Lord?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 21:4 And the Gibeonites said to him, It is not a question of silver and gold between us
    and Saul or his family; and it is not in our power to put to death any man in Israel. And he said,
    Say, then, what am I to do for you?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 21:5 And they said to the king, As for the man by whom we were wasted, and who made
    designs against us to have us completely cut off from the land of Israel,

    2 </br></br>Samuel 21:6 Let seven men of his family be given up to us and we will put an end to them by
    hanging them before the Lord in Gibeon, on the hill of the Lord. And the king said, I will give
    them.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 21:7 But the king did not give up Mephibosheth, the son of Saul's son Jonathan, because
    of the Lord's oath made between David and Jonathan, the son of Saul.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 21:8 But the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Saul to whom Rizpah,
    the daughter of Aiah, had given birth; and the five sons of Saul's daughter Merab, whose father was
    Adriel, the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:

    2 </br></br>Samuel 21:9 And he gave them up to the Gibeonites, and they put them to death, hanging them
    on the mountain before the Lord; all seven came to their end together in the first days of the grain-
    cutting, at the start of the cutting of the barley.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 21:10 And Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, took haircloth, placing it on the rock as a bed
    for herself, from the start of the grain-cutting till rain came down on them from heaven; and she did
    not let the birds of the air come near them by day, or the beasts of the field by night.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 21:11 And news was given to David of what Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, one of Saul's
    wives, had done.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 21:12 And David went and took the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from the men of
    Jabesh-gilead, who had taken them away secretly from the public place of Beth-shan, where the
    Philistines had put them, hanging up the bodies there on the day when they put Saul to death in
    Gilboa:
    ---------------------Page 600---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 21:13 And he took the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from that place; and they got
    together the bones of those who had been put to death by hanging.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 21:14 And they put them with the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the resting-place
    of Kish, his father, in Zela in the country of Benjamin; they did all the king had given them orders
    to do. And after that, God gave ear to their prayers for the land.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 21:15 And the Philistines went to war again with Israel; and David went down with his
    people, and while they were at Gob they had a fight with the Philistines:

    2 </br></br>Samuel 21:16 And there came against David one of the offspring of the Rephaim, whose spear
    was three hundred shekels of brass in weight, and having a new sword, he made an attempt to put
    David to death.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 21:17 But Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, came to his help, and, turning on the Philistine,
    gave him his death-blow. Then David's men took an oath, and said, Never again are you to go out
    with us to the fight, so that you may not put out the light of Israel.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 21:18 Now after this there was war with the Philistines again at Gob, and Sibbecai the
    Hushathite put to death Saph, one of the offspring of the Rephaim.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 21:19 And again there was war with the Philistines at Gob, and Elhanan, the son of Jair
    the Beth-lehemite, put to death Goliath the Gittite, the stem of whose spear was like a cloth-
    worker's rod.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 21:20 And again there was war at Gath, where there was a very tall man, who had
    twenty-four fingers and toes, six fingers on his hands and six toes on his feet; he was one of the
    offspring of the Rephaim.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 21:21 And when he was purposing to put shame on Israel, Jonathan, the son of Shimei,
    David's brother, put him to death.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 21:22 These four were of the offspring of the Rephaim in Gath; and they came to their
    end by the hands of David and his servants.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:1 And David made a song to the Lord in these words, on the day when the Lord made
    him free from the hands of all his haters, and from the hand of Saul:

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:2 And he said, The Lord is my Rock, my walled town, and my saviour, even mine;

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:3 My God, my Rock, in him will I put my faith; my breastplate, and the horn of my
    salvation, my high tower, and my safe place; my saviour, who keeps me safe from the violent man.
    ---------------------Page 601---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:4 I will send up my cry to the Lord, who is to be praised; so will I be made safe from
    those who are against me.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:5 For the waves of death came round me, and the seas of evil put me in fear;

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:6 The cords of hell were round me: the nets of death came on me.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:7 In my trouble my voice went up to the Lord, and my cry to my God: my voice came
    to his hearing in his holy Temple, and my prayer came to his ears.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:8 Then the earth was moved with a violent shock; the bases of heaven were moved
    and shaking, because he was angry.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:9 There went up a smoke from his nose, and a fire of destruction from his mouth:
    coals were lighted by it.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:10 The heavens were bent, so that he might come down; and it was dark under his
    feet.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:11 And he went through the air, seated on a storm-cloud: going quickly on the wings
    of the wind.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:12 And he made the dark his tent round him, a mass of waters, thick clouds of the
    skies.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:13 Before his shining light his dark clouds went past, raining ice and coals of fire.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:14 The Lord made thunder in the heavens, and the voice of the Highest was sounding
    out.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:15 And he sent out his arrows, driving them in all directions; by his flames of fire
    they were troubled.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:16 Then the deep beds of the sea were seen, and the bases of the world were
    uncovered, because of the Lord's wrath, because of the breath of his mouth.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:17 He sent from on high, he took me, pulling me out of great waters.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:18 He made me free from my strong hater, from those who were against me, because
    they were stronger than I.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:19 They came on me in the day of my trouble: but the Lord was my support.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:20 He took me out into a wide place; he was my saviour because he had delight in
    me.
    ---------------------Page 602---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:21 The Lord gives me the reward of my righteousness, because my hands are clean
    before him.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:22 For I have kept the ways of the Lord; I have not been turned away in sin from my
    God.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:23 For all his decisions were before me, and I did not put away his laws from me.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:24 And I was upright before him, and I kept myself from sin.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:25 Because of this the Lord has given me the reward of my righteousness, because
    my hands are clean in his eyes.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:26 On him who has mercy you will have mercy; to the upright you will be upright;

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:27 He who is holy will see that you are holy; but to the man whose way is not straight
    you will be a hard judge.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:28 For you are the saviour of those who are in trouble; but your eyes are on men of
    pride, to make them low.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:29 For you are my light, O Lord; and the Lord will make the dark bright for me.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:30 By your help I have made a way through the wall which was shutting me in: by the
    help of my God I have gone over a wall.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:31 As for God, his way is all good: the word of the Lord is tested; he is a safe cover
    for all those who put their faith in him.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:32 For who is God but the Lord? and who is a Rock but our God?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:33 God puts a strong band about me, guiding me in a straight way.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:34 He makes my feet like roes' feet, and puts me on high places.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:35 He makes my hands expert in war, so that a bow of brass is bent by my arms.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:36 You have given me the breastplate of your salvation, and your mercy has made me
    great.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:37 You have made my steps wide under me, so that my feet make no slip.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:38 I go after my haters and overtake them; not turning back till they are all overcome.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:39 I have sent destruction on them and given them wounds, so that they are not able
    to get up: they are stretched under my feet.
    ---------------------Page 603---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:40 For I have been armed by you with strength for the fight: you have made low
    under me those who came out against me.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:41 By you their backs are turned in flight, so that my haters are cut off.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:42 They were crying out, but there was no one to come to their help: even to the Lord,
    but he gave them no answer.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:43 Then they were crushed as small as the dust of the earth, stamped down under my
    feet like the waste of the streets.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:44 You have made me free from the fightings of my people; you have made me the
    head of the nations: a people of whom I had no knowledge will be my servants.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:45 Men of other countries will, with false hearts, put themselves under my authority:
    from the time when my name comes to their ears, they will be ruled by me.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:46 They will be wasted away, they will come out of their secret places shaking with
    fear.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:47 The Lord is living; praise be to my Rock, and let the God of my salvation be
    honoured:

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:48 It is God who sends punishment on my haters, and puts peoples under my rule.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:49 He makes me free from my haters: I am lifted up over those who come up against
    me: you have made me free from the violent man.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:50 Because of this I will give you praise, O Lord, among the nations, and will make a
    song of praise to your name.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 22:51 Great salvation does he give to his king; he has mercy on the king of his selection,
    David, and on his seed for ever.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:1 Now these are the last words of David. David, the son of Jesse, says, the man who
    was lifted up on high, the man on whom the God of Jacob put the holy oil, the loved one of Israel's
    songs, says:

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:2 The spirit of the Lord had voice through me, his word was on my tongue.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:3 The God of Israel said, the word of the Rock of Israel came to me: When an upright
    king is ruling over men, when he is ruling in the fear of God,
    ---------------------Page 604---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:4 It is as the light of the morning, when the sun comes up, a morning without clouds;
    making young grass come to life from the earth.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:5 For is not my house so with God? For he has made with me an eternal agreement,
    ordered in all things and certain: as for all my salvation and all my desire, will he not give it
    increase?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:6 But the evil-doers, all of them, will be like thorns to be pushed away, because they
    may not be gripped in the hand:

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:7 But anyone touching them has to be armed with iron and the rod of a spear; and
    they will be burned with fire, every one of them.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:8 These are the names of David's men of war: Ishbaal the Hachmonite, chief of the
    three; his axe was lifted up against eight hundred put to death at one time.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:9 After him was Eleazar, the son of Dodai the Ahohite, one of the three great fighters,
    who was with David in Pas-dammim when the Philistines came together there for the fight; and
    when the men of Israel had gone in flight,

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:10 He was with David and went on fighting the Philistines till his hand became tired
    and stiff from gripping his sword: and that day the Lord gave a great salvation, and the people came
    back after him only to take the goods of the Philistines.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:11 After him was Shammah, the son of Ela the Hararite. And the Philistines came
    together in Lehi, where there was a bit of land full of seed; and the people went in flight from the
    Philistines.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:12 But he kept his place in the middle of the bit of land, and kept back their attack
    and overcame the Philistines: and the Lord gave a great salvation.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:13 And three of the thirty went down at the start of the grain-cutting, and they came
    to David at the strong place of Adullam; and the band of Philistines had taken up their position in
    the valley of Rephaim.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:14 And at that time David had taken cover in the strong place, and an armed force of
    the Philistines was in Beth-lehem.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:15 And David, moved by a strong desire, said, If only someone would give me a
    drink of water from the water-hole of Beth-lehem, by the doorway into the town!

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:16 And the three men, forcing their way through the Philistine army, got water from
    the water-hole of Beth-lehem, by the doorway into the town, and took it back to David: but he
    would not take it, but, draining it out, made an offering of it to the Lord.
    ---------------------Page 605---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:17 And he said, Far be it from me, O Lord, to do this; how may I take as my drink the
    life-blood of men who have put their lives in danger? So he would not take it. These things did the
    three great men of war.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:18 And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the thirty. He
    put to death three hundred with his spear, and he got for himself a name among the thirty.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:19 Was he not the noblest of the thirty? so he was made their captain: but he was not
    equal to the first three.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:20 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, a fighting man of Kabzeel, had done great acts;
    he put to death the two sons of Ariel of Moab: he went down into a hole and put a lion to death in
    time of snow:

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:21 And he made an attack on an Egyptian, a tall man: and the Egyptian had a spear in
    his hand; but he went down to him with a stick, and pulling the spear out of the hands of the
    Egyptian, put him to death with that same spear.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:22 These were the acts of Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, who had a great name among
    the thirty men of war.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:23 He was honoured over the rest of the thirty, but he was not equal to the first three.
    And David put him over the fighting men who kept him safe.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:24 Asahel, the brother of Joab, was one of the thirty; and Elhanan, the son of Dodai,
    of Beth-lehem,

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:25 Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:26 Helez the Paltite, Ira, the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:27 Abiezer the Anathothite, Sibbecai the Hushathite,

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:28 Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:29 Heldai, the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai, the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the
    children of Benjamin,

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:30 Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the valleys of Gaash,

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:31 Abiel the Arbathite, Azmaveth of Bahurim,

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:32 Eliahba the Shaalbonite, Jashen the Gunite,

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:33 Jonathan, the son of Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam, the son of Sharar the Hararite,
    ---------------------Page 606---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:34 Eliphelet, the son of Ahasbai the Maacathite, Eliam, the son of Ahithophel the
    Gilonite,

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:35 Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Archite,

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:36 Igal, the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:37 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, who had the care of the arms of
    Joab, son of Zeruiah,

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:38 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,

    2 </br></br>Samuel 23:39 Uriah the Hittite: thirty-seven in number.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 24

    2 </br></br>Samuel 24:1 Again the wrath of the Lord was burning against Israel, and moving David against
    them, he said, Go, take the number of Israel and Judah.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 24:2 And the king said to Joab and the captains of the army, who were with him, Go now
    through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan as far as Beer-sheba, and have all the people numbered, so
    that I may be certain of the number of the people.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 24:3 And Joab said to the king, Whatever the number of the people, may the Lord make
    it a hundred times as much, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it: but why does my lord the
    king take pleasure in doing this thing?

    2 </br></br>Samuel 24:4 But the king's order was stronger than Joab and the captains of the army. And Joab
    and the captains of the army went out from the king, to take the number of the children of Israel.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 24:5 And they went over Jordan, and starting from Aroer, from the town which is in the
    middle of the valley, they went in the direction of the Gadites, and on to Jazer;

    2 </br></br>Samuel 24:6 Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of the Hittites under Hermon; and they
    came to Dan, and from Dan they came round to Zidon,

    2 </br></br>Samuel 24:7 And to the walled town of Tyre, and to all the towns of the Hivites and the
    Canaanites: and they went out to the South of Judah at Beer-sheba.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 24:8 So after going through all the land in every direction, they came to Jerusalem at the
    end of nine months and twenty days.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 24:9 And Joab gave the king the number of all the people: there were in Israel eight
    hundred thousand fighting men able to take up arms; and the men of Judah were five hundred
    thousand.
    ---------------------Page 607---------------------

    2 </br></br>Samuel 24:10 And after the people had been numbered, David's heart was troubled. And David
    said to the Lord, Great has been my sin in doing this; but now, O Lord, be pleased to take away the
    sin of your servant, for I have done very foolishly

    2 </br></br>Samuel 24:11 And David got up in the morning; now the word of the Lord had come to the
    prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,

    2 </br></br>Samuel 24:12 Go and say to David, The Lord says, Three things are offered to you: say which of
    them you will have, and I will do it to you.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 24:13 So Gad came to David, and gave him word of this and said to him, Are there to be
    three years when there is not enough food in your land? or will you go in flight from your haters for
    three months, while they go after you? or will you have three days of violent disease in your land?
    take thought and say what answer I am to give to him who sent me.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 24:14 And David said to Gad, This is a hard decision for me to make: let us come into
    the hands of the Lord, for great are his mercies: let me not come into the hands of men.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 24:15 So David made selection of the disease; and the time was the days of the grain-
    cutting, when the disease came among the people, causing the death of seventy thousand men from
    Dan as far as Beer-sheba.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 24:16 And when the hand of the angel was stretched out in the direction of Jerusalem,
    for its destruction, the Lord had regret for the evil, and said to the angel who was sending
    destruction on the people, It is enough; do no more. And the angel of the Lord was by the grain-
    floor of Araunah the Jebusite.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 24:17 And when David saw the angel who was causing the destruction of the people, he
    said to the Lord, Truly, the sin is mine; I have done wrong: but these are only sheep; what have
    they done? let your hand be against me and against my family.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 24:18 And that day Gad came to David and said to him, Go up, and put up an altar to the
    Lord on the grain-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 24:19 So David went up, as Gad had said and as the Lord had given orders.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 24:20 And Araunah, looking out, saw the king and his servants coming to him: and
    Araunah went out, and went down on his face to the earth before the king.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 24:21 And Araunah said, Why has my lord the king come to his servant? And David
    said, To give you a price for your grain-floor, so that I may put up an altar to the Lord, and the
    disease may be stopped among the people.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 24:22 And Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take whatever seems right to
    him, and make an offering of it: see, here are the oxen for the burned offering, and the grain-
    cleaning instruments and the ox-yokes for wood:

    2 </br></br>Samuel 24:23 All this does the servant of my lord the king give to the king. And Araunah said,
    May the Lord your God be pleased with your offering!

    2 </br></br>Samuel 24:24 And the king said to Araunah, No, but I will give you a price for it; I will not give
    to the Lord my God burned offerings for which I have given nothing. So David got the grain-floor
    and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.

    2 </br></br>Samuel 24:25 And there David put up an altar to the Lord, making burned offerings and peace-
    offerings. So the Lord gave ear to his prayer for the land, and the disease came to an end in Israel.
